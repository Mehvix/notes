<ul>
<li>History of the variation of fire activity over space and time at the landscape scale in different regions of the world</li>
<li>Pyrogeography started in
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian>Silurian period</a> when plant life began</li>
<li>Fire requirements: 13% Oxygen in a normal environment and 30% Oxygen in damp vegetation.</li>
<li>Fires are a selection force in the evolution of plants</li>

1. Natural Biospheric Fire &ndash; Natural Fire Regime
<a class=anchor href=#1-natural-biospheric-fire----natural-fire-regime>#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Potential) start date for pyrogeography</li>
<li>During
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian>Silurian</a> and Devonian Periods (440-400 HYA)</li>
<li>Natural fire regime started during this period because it was the first time that the fire triangle came together</li>
<li>Fire triangle:
<ul>
<li><em>Ignition Source</em>: (Since beginning) Natural ignition from lightening (most common), volcanoes, (rarely) falling rock sparks
<ul>
<li>These natural sources tend to only begin fires in the dry season</li>
<li>Lightening is most common in mountain regions (over a costal region)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Oxygen Source</em>: (Cambrian period) Atmospheric Oxygen (from photosynthetic plants) leads to appearance of photosynthetic organisms</li>
<li><em>Fuel Source</em>: (Silurian and Devonian Periods) Enough terrestrial plants in ecosystems to acts as fuel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During this time, natural fire regimes evolved
<ul>
<li>As coal became more common (Carboniferous period), fires did too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Started long time ago, before humans and dinosaurs</li>

<ul>
<li>Defining the bridge between phase one and two is difficult</li>
<li>Definition problems
<ul>
<li>Do we ask when did (modern humans / hominin ancestors) develop the ability to control and utilize fire?</li>
<li>We also need to distinguish between (1) controlling / utilizing fire and (2) being able to start a fire on a whim</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Archeological problems
<ul>
<li>Fire exists naturally, so we can&rsquo;t assume all fire evidence is from human action</li>
<li>Other natural processes can look like fire (e.g. staining by minerals in soil, oxidation causing reddish patches)</li>
<li>Combustion of natural objects (e.g. bushes) can leave charcoal which looks like a human hearth
<ul>
<li>Additionally, evidence of a hearth doesn&rsquo;t mean that humans started/controlled fire</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provides a single snapshot, has little temporal depth</li>

<li>Archaeological Record Analysis
<ul>
<li>In the field:
<ul>
<li>Observation and collection of materials</li>
<li>Study the geology of the site</li>

</li>
<li>In the lab:
<ul>
<li>Microscopic analysis to see if there was burning</li>
<li>If so, could the location of the sample been transported after combustion?</li>

<li><em>Western US</em>: forests have also experienced an increase in hazardous fuels due to highly effective fire suppression policy that excluded fires for much of the 20th century</li>
<li><em>Eastern US</em>: Fire suppression has shifted oak and pine woodlands to mesophytic hardwoods consequently reducing flammability and fire activity</li>

<li>Beneficial Attributes
<ul>
<li>Cooking hypothesis
<ul>
<li>Key claim: Fire + cooking started with the Homo erectus. As such, humans have evolved around a cooked diet that they can&rsquo;t live without</li>
<li>Led to fitness advantage</li>
<li>More energy + nutrient from food, enabling body and brain size increase</li>
<li>Detoxing effect</li>
<li>Increase digestibility of all food</li>
<li>Cooking takes time, leading to social development
<ul>
<li>Distribution of tasks among group: (collection, preparation, even stealing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cooking accounts for reduction in jaw, tooth size (due to softer food), stomach, and digestive system size</li>
<li>There is no evidence of modern human societies existing without cooked food</li>
<li>Counterpoints:
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s still unclear that Homo erectus controlled fire</li>
<li>There are some sites that show no example of cooking: e.g. Neanderthal sites in cold climates</li>
<li>Energetic effects aren&rsquo;t well quantified</li>
<li>Digestive evolution may not have been linear; other adaptations related to fire occurred after Homo erectus</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Protection benefits at night (especially versus the alternative: sleeping in trees)</li>
<li>Allowed much better vision in caves
<ul>
<li>Enables cave art</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence that some hominids could use fire to morph certain woods into tools (e.g. digging sticks, hafted spears)</li>
<li>Allowed humans to colonize colder environments</li>
<li>Increase prey abundances, maintain mosaic landscapes, and increase pyrodiversity and succession stage heterogeneity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social bonding
<ul>
<li>Led to camp fires</li>
<li>Allows people to stay up later</li>
<li>Fire could be used as a story telling enhancer, means to pass on history, culture, etc.</li>

<li>CA has a diverse ecosystem; each site is similar to another one elsewhere though</li>
<li>What sets CA apart is the scale and intensity of it&rsquo;s fires</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>CA&rsquo;s fires are unique in that they lead national discourse</li>
<li>Texas views the US as France views the EUnion &ndash; a canvas to project it&rsquo;s ideals</li>
<li>Alaska view the US as a source of subsidies. It&rsquo;s isolated and treated almost as a commonwealth.</li>
<li>California shares sizes, political isolation, and sense of selfhood with the aforementioned.

<li>Unlike AL, it has a strong and wide economy</li>
<li>Unlike TX, it has been independent but not secessionist and, while CA and TX both have strong cultures, CA doesn&rsquo;t project its</li>

<li>Expanding development</li>
<li>Droughts</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Difficult to predict future fire regimes well</li>
<li>Changes in human behavior can amplify, but tend to <em>cancel out climatic effects</em> on fire regimes
<ul>
<li>For example, humans alter through changing land use, ignitions, fuel conditions, or fire suppression</li>
<li>Fire <strong>activity</strong> is influenced by climate variability
<ul>
<li>More (less) fire occurred in dry (wet) and warm (cool) years, and high-fire years were preceded by moist and sometimes cool conditions 1&ndash;4 y earlier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Sierra Nevada) <strong>fire-regime shifts</strong> correlate to <strong>SES changes</strong>, <em>not shifts in climate</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are best bet is to look at history and see how fire regimes changed from past changes in socioeconomic variables
<ul>
<li>Climate increased fire activity on a large-scale <strong>after Native American depopulation</strong> reduced the buffering effect of due to their burnings
<ul>
<li>Sierra Nevada tribes were hunter-gatherers who used sophisticated burning practices to manage resources</li>
<li>The fire index nearly doubled after depopulation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Later Euro-American settlement and fire suppression buffered fire activity from temperature increases
<ul>
<li>Logging, fire suppression, livestock increase (grazing effects)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The overall sensitivity of fire regimes to low-frequency temperature variation is related to temperature-driven vegetation changes that alter fuel structure and fuel type</li>

1. Coring Lakes
<a class=anchor href=#1-coring-lakes>#</a>
</h3>
<p>
<img src=/docs/anthro-c12ac/imgs/lake-core.png alt="Lake Coring"></p>
<ul>
<li>Annual layers are laid down in some lakes
<ul>
<li>Realistically you can date to around fifty years of accuracy</li>
<li>This samples have deeper temporal depth vs other methods</li>
<li>We can also radiocarbon date these samples to determine the time period</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to sample
<ul>
<li>Charcoal present is indicates fire
<ul>
<li>Larger particle tend to travel small distances</li>
<li>Smaller particles can travel much longer distances</li>
<li>Some plants may be easier/harder to identify than others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pollen analysis can give you knowledge on what (wind pollinated) plants were common at the time in that area
<ul>
<li>Provides broad perspective of vegetation over time</li>
<li>Pollen can travel far, so resolution isn&rsquo;t great</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phytoliths
<ul>
<li>Tiny particles formed in many plants</li>
<li>They don&rsquo;t break down &ndash; can stay in soil for hundreds to thousands of years!</li>
<li>Can be used to identify plant species</li>
<li>Cons: Not all plants produce them; overrepresented in grasses</li>

</h3>
<p>
<img src=/docs/anthro-c12ac/imgs/tree-core.png alt="Tree Coring"></p>
<ul>
<li>You basically jab a metal straw into a tree and get a sample of the tree
<ul>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t harm tree, tree naturally patches the hole itself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These sample contain rings</li>
<li>Give us age and growth rate of the tree
<ul>
<li>Growth increase in rings can allude to neighboring trees being killed</li>
<li>Dead neighboring trees means less canopy blocking sunshine and less trees competing for nutrients</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple samples can give us an overview of a landscape
<ul>
<li>Do we see a multi-age forest?</li>
<li>Do we see synchrony in growth rate?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Crossdating</strong>: To identify events, we compare the sample&rsquo;s tree rings to those of other &ldquo;regular&rdquo; trees in different areas at the same time</li>
</ul>

3. Fire Scars
<a class=anchor href=#3-fire-scars>#</a>
</h3>
<p>
<img src=/docs/anthro-c12ac/imgs/fire-scar.png alt="Scar Example"></p>
<ul>
<li>Fire scars occur when fire kills part of the cambium below bark, leaving a wound
<ul>
<li>The scar itself takes ~10 years to show up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple dated wounds allude to multiple fire occurrences</li>
<li>You can also get the seasonality too
<ul>
<li>Spring trees have warmer water so the scars are lighter in color</li>
<li>Fall/winter trees have slower cell movement, so the scars are darker (this is called &ldquo;latewood&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Therefore, how deep the scar is in the wood corresponds to the season the fire occurred</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use crossdating for high accuracy and precision</li>
<li>Pines, White oaks, Sequoia, Redwood, Incense, and Cedars are all good trees to take samples from</li>
<li>Wedges:
<ul>
<li>You can take wedges from the tree to get access to the ring view</li>
<li>Both living and dead wood samples can be dated</li>
<li>Pines, redwood, cedar, giant sequoia are all rot resistant thus good species to sample</li>
<li>You ideally want to cut a thin wedge that has a large surface area and includes center of tree</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Downsides
<ul>
<li>Trees heal covering up scars or scars are in an exposed cavity that can be seen</li>
<li>Problem when fire interval &lt; 10 years (such as cultural burnings)
<ul>
<li>Most of the time fires aren&rsquo;t severe enough to scare deeply enough and if they do scar, it&rsquo;s feint</li>
<li>Only 5% of trees sampled scarred in Sierra Nevada</li>
</ul>

Indigenous Stewards of Land and Sea

<ul>
<li>Better way of describing CA Indians (compared to hunter gatherers)</li>
<li>Indians worked/work as <strong>Active Agents to Augment Environmental Productivity and Diversity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Seascape Stewardship</strong>: Various ways Native people enhanced the productivity and sustainability of shellfish populations and fisheries</li>
<li><strong>Landscape Stewardship</strong>:</li>
<li>Anthropological Rethinking back to 1940s, picks up steam in 1970s, 1980s that culminates with Anderson 2005 publication</li>
<li>Various Methods Employed in Landscape Management Practices:
<ul>
<li>Transplanting Water Diversion</li>
<li>Pruning/Coppicing</li>
<li>Weeding/Tillage Sowing/Broadcasting Seeds</li>
<li>All for the purpose of enhancing productivity of natural plants/animals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Most Important</strong>: Anthropogenic or Cultural Burning was the key method of stewardship
<ul>
<li>Long History in California (Channel Islands)?</li>
<li>Mediterranean Climate is Fire Enabler
<ul>
<li>Wet cool winters lead to high plant production</li>
<li>Dry and drought-ful summers provide a dry, extensive fuel base</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Native Californians realized that fire was a natural occurrence and learned to live with fire</li>
<li>Reasoning for Cultural Burnings (Landscape scale)
<ol>
<li>Fires Control Insects/Pests</li>
<li>Remove Detritus, clean-up landscape
<ul>
<li>Allows light through which leads to healthy growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open Pathways</li>
<li>Use Fire to Hunt Game (driving animals into traps/valleys) and Insects</li>
<li>Produce Straight Stems for cordage, baskets</li>
<li>Augment Growth/Diversity of Plants and Animals in Territory
<ul>
<li>Grasslands and other plants may have deeper roots which make them more difficult to kill</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increases productivity of nutrient rich plants that animals eat
<ul>
<li>Deer heard sizes are correlated with burnings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stimulate Growth of broad spectrum of economic resources
<ul>
<li>Through burning in Patchy Mosaics</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>How Areas Were Burned
<ul>
<li>Instigate fire regimes with frequent, small, low-intensity surface burns
<ul>
<li>Seasonality of burning very important to minimize risk of catastrophic fires</li>
<li>Additionally, risk reduced by reduce fuel loads + creating fuel breaks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Burn to increase productivity and stimulate growth of broad spectrum of economic resources
<ul>
<li>Notably shrubs with berries, oak woodlands, coniferous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intentionally create Patchy Mosaics
<ul>
<li>Increase <strong>quantity, diversity and sustainability</strong> of key plants and animals</li>
<li>Different environments benefit from different style burnings resulting in checkerboard-esque patterns</li>
<li>Used for foods, medicines, and raw materials</li>
<li>Minimize risk of catastrophic fires due to reduced fuel loads and fire breaks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Burn areas contained by natural rivers/hills/ridges/basalt flows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implications of Cultural Burning
<ul>
<li>Not Pristine Wilderness, but Managed Anthropogenic Landscape &ndash; you have to take into account Indians when looking at CA&rsquo;s landscape</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t do restoration without bringing in people
<ul>
<li>Now, because of a lack of recent cultural burnings, some habitats are struggling</li>

<h3 id=controversy-regarding-cultural-burnings>
Controversy regarding cultural burnings
<a class=anchor href=#controversy-regarding-cultural-burnings>#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some argue that cultural fires were small in size, near villages, and had little impact on the larger ecosystem</li>
<li>Rather, natural fires best explain these fires</li>
<li>Evidence Types tend to be soft;
<ol>
<li>Tribal Oral Traditions have a Short Temporal Depth for cultural burnings
<ul>
<li>Observations limited primarily to last 250 years</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limitations arise when primarily referring to Ethnohistoric Sources
<ul>
<li>Ethnohistoric Studies are from (typically Spaniard around 1600-1700) explorers and not trained as anthropologists</li>
<li>Accounts tend to be spotty, geographically biased, and not very detailed</li>
<li>Sources don&rsquo;t include key fire regime aspects (freq, seasonality, severity, area, synergy)</li>
<li>Susceptible to biases, uncertainty, and anecdotes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ethnographic Studies
<ul>
<li>Information is word of mouth history from within the tribe that&rsquo;s passed from one generation to another</li>
<li>Recorded by anthropologists</li>
<li>Information is very brief/general and lacking in our definition of fire regime now</li>
<li>Old archeologists may have viewed Indians as hunter/gatherers (which is wrong!)</li>
<li>Colonizers prevented cultural fires (fire exclusion)
<ul>
<li><strong>Fire exclusion</strong> is when fire is <em>indirectly removed</em> from the environment
<ul>
<li>E.x. adding livestock removes fuels, reducing/removing fire</li>
<li>E.x. Colonizers removing Natives (for reasons other than their cultural burnings) removed fires, changing fire regime</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whereas <strong>fire suppression</strong> is mindful + target specifically at <em>stopping fires</em>
<ul>
<li>E.x. Using firetrucks, airplanes, etc. to stop a fire from spreading</li>
<li>E.x laws preventing you from creating fires during the dry season</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thus, when we started Ethnographic studies in 1901(ish), we didn&rsquo;t see the history before because current tribes weren&rsquo;t allowed to perform cultural burnings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Instead, critics would like to see hard ecological data (fire scars, pollen analysis, charcoal accumulation, phytoliths)</li>
<li>Two main reasons to address these criticisms
<ol>
<li>Differential impacts due to colonialism in different spaces and at different times
<ul>
<li>Some areas colonized much earlier than others in the state
<ul>
<li>Central and Souther coast colonized 2.5 centuries ago by Spaniards</li>
<li>Others only were colonized during the gold rush)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some tribes subjected to Fire Exclusion/Suppression policies
<ul>
<li>Lacking specific information about when these policies were enacted</li>
<li>Tribes colonized during gold rush tend to have more information than those colonized earlier in time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequently, some tribes have not been able to practice Cultural burning for generations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Political Implications
<ul>
<li>Some scholars argue that there is no real evidence that Native people were good stewards of the land
<ul>
<li>Point to times when animals/plants went extinct</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequently, they should not play a special role in decision making Ecological restoration projects today
<ul>
<li>Nor play much of a role in the management of our public Lands today</li>

Timber Owners and Early Use of Fire (10/4)
<a class=anchor href=#timber-owners-and-early-use-of-fire-104>#</a>
</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>1880</strong>: Advocates for ‘light burning' in California appear &ndash; some thought fire was needed to manage forests
<ul>
<li>Whereas cultural burnings are done for <a href='javascript:document.querySelector("body > main > div > article > ul:nth-child(68) > li:nth-child(7) > ul > li:nth-child(4) > ol").scrollIntoView()'>specific intentional reasons</a>, light burning is done for other reasons such as reducing fuel, increasing food for livestock, and other economic reasons</li>
<li>That is, cultural burning is a form of light burning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1900:</strong> Debate start regarding fire management near Lake Almanor in CA
<ul>
<li>Private forest land owners practiced ‘light burning' following early Indian and sheep herder traditions</li>
<li>Most foresters dismissed this proposal as mere ‘Paiute Forestry' (derogatory term based on an Indian tribe)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1902:</strong>
<ul>
<li>H.J. Ostrander attacked ‘protectionist' policy of fire control as worse than effective because it allowed fuel to accumulate</li>
<li>US National Academy of Science committee on forest reserves urged fire control policy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1908:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gene Tolly: Sierra National Forest Ranger from 1905-1912 and cowboy assigned to range management for USFS</li>
<li>Gifford Pinchot: 1st Chief of the USFS</li>
<li>Tolly took Gifford on a back country trip through the Sierra National Forest to try and convince him to allow Indian Burning to keep meadows and forests from getting overgrown but Gifford didn&rsquo;t buy it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1910:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sunset magazine was an outlet used for forestry discussion at the time
<ul>
<li>G.L. Hoxie wrote in the magazine to advocated light burning claimed it should not be merely acceptable but made mandatory</li>
<li>Made economic, not ecological argument</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unfortunately at same time, Great Idaho Fire occurred
<ul>
<li>Burned 3 million acres and killed 85 people.</li>
<li>Happened due to drought period with ignitions from lightning, locomotives, and logging</li>
<li>Resulted in national debate:
<ul>
<li>Senator Weldon Heyburn (R-Idaho) led effort to disband the USFS so that private land owners could manage their own land</li>
<li>Others argued that the newly found US Forest Service (1905) should be expanded so that it could prevent future fires (happened, turns out govt tends to only grow bigger)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1930s:</strong> Two experiments were occurring in northeast CA around this time
<ol>
<li>Full Control
<ul>
<li>McCloud River Lumber Company</li>
<li>Use trains, hand crews, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Light Burning
<ul>
<li>Thomas Barlow (T.B.) Walker was raised from Minnesota and ran the Red River Lumber Co. near Lake Almanor</li>
<li>Clinton Walker (T.B&rsquo;s son) wrote a letter to the Red River Lumber Company in <strong>1938</strong> (years after he had left the Company) saying:
<ol>
<li>The general condition of the forests when the white man first came into CA was very excellent</li>
<li>Then came the foresters from Yale University and put the tourniquet on the forests</li>
<li>Would prefer to remove the tourniquet in our timber matters [which] is the lack of fire</li>
<li>I requested permission [to burn] from the State Forester and the USFS DuBois. Both refused</li>
<li>We proceeded to burn anyway, and Chief Forester Graves came out from Washington and DuBois and many others with cameras and notebooks to get damaging evidence</li>
<li>They stayed several days and followed the burning, with comment by Graves that the work was excellent</li>
<li>DuBois apologized to me for panning me in the newspapers previously</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Graves suggested that T.B underwrite a chair of fire protection at Yale University
<ul>
<li>Walker agreed, contributing $100,000 (a huge amount of funding 1900&rsquo;s). Harvey Chapman hired who was huge force in longleaf pine is southeast US</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Over the next decade trials done across the US, especially in pine belts of the West and South</li>
<li>Stuart Show (from Stanford btw) looked for light burning area around Mt. Hough, Claremont, Meadow Valley Country
<ul>
<li>Found a suitable area near Snake Lake</li>
<li>Commit data/scientific fraud by adding more fuel:
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ed and I did 250 acres alone and, except for the long hitch of work, didn&rsquo;t have any trouble. The only dishonest thing we did was to pile some pine limbwood in big fire scars of a few large pines, with the gratifying result that they burned down and became damage statistics&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Dave Rogers already had made up his mind regarding light burnings
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Went over nonchalantly to reburn Snake Lake (in 1920). It would have been O.K. except that Plumas Supervisor Dave Rogers came out the night of the burn, grabbed a brush burning torch and ended up stringing fire outside the line on two opposite ends. Then he left.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You can understand our deep affection for Dave and the Plumas&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>The use of fire in forest management was not given an objective evaluation anywhere in the Western US including Indigenous burning</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1940s:</strong> Harold Biswell was a professor in the Berkeley Forestry Department from 1947 - 1972
<ul>
<li>Biswell conducted prescribed fire research in the forests of Georgia from 1942 to 1947 when he was a researcher for the US Forest Service Southern Research Station</li>
<li>Began prescribed fire work in Ponderosa pine forests in 1951 (Boggs Mountain near Middletown as well as Teaford Ranch in the Southern Sierra near Bass Lake)
<ul>
<li>Both of these locations were private land because no government agency would let him burn in public land</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Said in his 1958 paper:
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At the time the idea of burning was fairly new to me and I looked upon fire as the arch enemy of forests and forestry&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>His 1958 paper showed it was possible to use fire in CA forest management and warned about future problems if fuels were not reduced
<ul>
<li>His conclusions were very controversial at the time</li>
<li>His PhD students recall
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There was little opposition to him burning in grasslands and shrublands, but when he began burning experiments in ponderosa pine forests, active and open criticism of him and his work exploded. He was referred to as &ldquo;Harry the Torch,&rdquo; &ldquo;Burn-Em-Up Biswell,&rdquo; and other derisive names, and not always behind his back&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>No forestry faculty would work with Biswell.
<ul>
<li>UCB Forestry faculty voted to forbid him or his graduate students to work at Blodgett Forest</li>
<li>(Scott&rsquo;s Opinion:) At the very least, some UC Berkeley forestry faculty should have worked cooperatively with Biswell to further explore this topic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In 1973, he was given the Berkeley Citation, awarded for his contribution to the University of California that &ldquo;go beyond the call of duty and whose achievements exceed the standards of excellence in their fields.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>He was the first UCB forestry professor to get this award</li>

<li>Influence of John Muir on <em>Conservation Movement</em> in USA in early 1900s
<ul>
<li>Early debate about conservation practices involving light burning, indigenous stewardship</li>
<li>Believed land was cathedral of nature and should be untouched (so no Indian burning!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>John Muir:
<ul>
<li>Argued for creations of pristine, natural preserves untouched by people</li>
<li>Did not Advocate for Native Stewardship Practices, such as Cultural Burning</li>
<li>Conservation Model - - Put Fence Around Property and keep people out</li>
<li>Fire Suppression Policies of Settler colonialism
<ul>
<li>One component of broader package of developments that have kept tribes from revitalizing cultural burning until recently</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Policies of extermination, genocide; poverty, diseases, food shortages; limited sized reservations; many California tribes unacknowledged; massive environmental destruction of tribal lands</li>
<li>Upshot of Discussion, up until the 1960s-1970s, Native Californians had little or no land to call their own, minimal tribal land, little access to resources on Public Lands in California for harvesting foods, medicines, raw materials for baskets, etc.</li>
<li>Greatly curtailed ability to undertake Indigenous Landscape Stewardship Practices, such as Cultural Burning</li>

<li>Nathanial Kenny wrote an article on the US Fire Service
<ul>
<li>Published in 1956 in National Geographic</li>
<li>Argued that at the end of the day, science would be the most crucial role in controlling fires</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that equipment and development alone will show us how to keep having the relatively few big fires… Researchers must let their imaginations soar for answers that today would seem fantastic&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Fire Suppression:
<ul>
<li>Begins around 1905</li>
<li>Approximately 80,000 fires/year today</li>
<li>98-99% of all wildland fires out at less than 5 acres in size</li>
<li>95% of area burned today is from 1-2% of the fires that escape initial attack
<ul>
<li>Often occurs in terrible conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4.5 million acres once burned in CA
<ul>
<li><strong>Over half Tribal burning</strong> &ndash; 10-35% of this area burns today in most years but 2020 will burn this amount for 1st time (Stephens et al. 2007)</li>
<li>Size is only one aspect &ndash; what is the fire mortality? what is the distribution? etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not just area burned, <strong>burn patterns inside</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Historical data yields insight into controls on forest structure in pine-mixed conifer forests
<ul>
<li>In 1911 photograph and datasets we can see much more sunny forests</li>
<li>This is due to more frequent, natural/cultural burnings vs today&rsquo;s fire suppression</li>
<li>Kern National Forest Structure and Composition (Stephens et al. 2015)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Southern California and Baja Forests (Stephens et al 2003)
<ul>
<li>Drought from 1999-2002 in southern California and northwestern Mexico
<ul>
<li>Only 5 inches of rain one year, driest on record in So Cal mountains another year</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fire suppression and past forest harvesting have increased forest density in So Cal (Minnich et al 1995)
<ul>
<li>Native bark beetle population increased because of weaker trees</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sierra San Pedro Martir / Northern Baja California
<ul>
<li>Mediterranean climate</li>
<li>Annual precipitation averages 24 in</li>
<li>Area has been grazed by livestock</li>
<li>Similar to southern California and eastern Sierra Nevada</li>
<li>Fire suppression begins in 1970, no harvesting</li>
<li>SSPM Mission in 1794 severely impacted populations</li>
<li>Within the California floristic province</li>
<li>Forested area of around 40,000 acres</li>
<li>Fire suppression and past forest harvesting have increased forest density (Minnich et al. 1995)</li>
<li>Elevation upper plateau 8800 ft
<ul>
<li>3 large plateaus, Peninsular Mountains</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jeffrey pine-mixed conifer forests
<ul>
<li>Similar to souther CA and eastern Sierra Nevada</li>
<li>Fire suppression begins in 1970s, <strong>no harvesting</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3 indigenous cultures used portions of the SSPM outside the winter: Paipai Kiliwa, Nakipa
<ul>
<li>SSPM Mission in 1794 severely impacted populations</li>
<li>Mission lasted 8 years due to extreme climate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SSPM wildfire July 4, 2003
<ul>
<li>Started in chaparral below forest</li>
<li>Fire burned approximately 600 acres
<ul>
<li>More shrubland than forest burned</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Largest fire in 20 years
<ul>
<li>Occurred at end of sever drought, 1999-2002</li>
<li>Same drought as in SoCal
<ul>
<li>SoCal drought killed millions of trees w/o fire</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only 20% of trees killed
<ul>
<li>Jeffrey pine more dominate after fire, trees and seedlings (less white fir, incense-cedar)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fire was very patchy
<ul>
<li>Directly linked to heterogeneity of forest structure and fuels pre-fire</li>
<li>Mortality very low even after 4 year drought and wildfire (Stephens et al. 2008)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Incredible forest resilience!!
<ul>
<li>Gives us hope in California</li>
<li>To answer Nathanial Kenny &ndash; Fire back, restoration thinning, and stewardship are also key</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary
<ul>
<li>Tree density increased 2-3 times in mixed conifer forests since 1911</li>
<li>Forest change has decreased resiliency</li>
<li>Climate change will make this situation worse</li>
<li>Need increased fuel reduction treatments and wildfire for resource benefit frequent fire forests - critical</li>

<ul>
<li>Asked to carry out report by US govt</li>
<li>Carried out in Yellowstone</li>
<li>Took view of the whole ecosystem, not just a single issue</li>
<li>Animal populations &lsquo;<em>protected</em>&rsquo; from hunting and habitats &lsquo;<em>protected</em>&rsquo; from wildfire
<ul>
<li>Wolfs (predators) were hunted before so that elk could thrive</li>
<li>Elk thrived too much; Elk became hunted because their population grew so high</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Habitat is not stable that can be set aside and preserved behind a fence</li>
<li>Goal of Park Management in the United States
<ul>
<li>Each park be maintained, or where necessary recreated, in the condition when first visited by the white man
<ul>
<li>Wilderness isn&rsquo;t devoid of people; need to consider native stewards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A primitive America could be recreated, using skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity</li>
<li>The forty-niners poured over the Sierra Nevada and found big trees in gigantic magnificence
<ul>
<li>Ground was grass parkland, in springtime carpeted with wildflowers (<em>No mention of indigenous management</em>)</li>
<li>Today dog-hair thicket of young trees and mature brush—a direct function of protection from <strong>natural fires</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is it possible that the primitive open forest could be restored? And if so, how? (<em>Big question even for today</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Policies of Park Management
<ul>
<li>Research, not intuition, should form the basis for all management</li>
<li>Agency best to study park management is the National Park Service</li>
<li>Management without knowledge would be a dangerous policy indeed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Methods of Habitat Management
<ul>
<li>Of the methods of manipulating vegetation, controlled use of fire is the most &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and the cheapest and <em>easiest</em> to apply (easy?? Maybe in the 1960&rsquo;s)</li>
<li>Forest and chaparral areas protected from fire may require careful advance treatment (Harold Biswell influence?)</li>
<li>Trees and mature brush may have to be cut, piled, and burned before ground fire (Harold Biswell did this with his early burning)</li>
<li>Once fuel is reduced, periodic burning can be conducted safely and at low expense (Biswell)
<ul>
<li>Against wind and down hill results in slowest and least severe fire conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;We are calling for a set of ecologic skills unknown in this country today&rdquo; (Indigenous?)</li>
<li>&ldquo;It will not be done by passive protection alone&rdquo; (Big statement at the time, Still important today)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Very powerful ideas included, changes NPS course of action (no Indigenous people though)</li>

<li>Opportunities for improved fire use and management in California: lessons from Western Australia (WA)</li>
<li>Treatment size - Prescribed burn units <strong>much larger</strong> than those implemented in the US - make ours bigger
<ul>
<li>Burns averaging in excess of 5000 ac, with some as large as 25,000 acres in Western Australia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) fire managers take advantage of relatively few burn windows to burn large areas
<ul>
<li>Managers use weekends and nights, if conditions are favorable</li>
<li>Have multiple burn plans in place in each region in order react quickly to conditions</li>
<li>DEC begins training new seasonal crews on prescribed fires in the spring burning season</li>
<li>DEC has responsibility for fire management across all public lands in the state of Western Australia (integrated versus USA system)</li>
<li>Impossible to combine the many county, state, and federal agencies of CA under one agency but we need to do better</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similar to California, prescribed fire in Western Australia is a contentious issue, particularly some urban residents who not aware of benefits of prescribed fire</li>
<li>Indigenous burning not integrated with DEC burning &ndash; rare across Australia at least in 2013</li>
<li>DEC uses a focused outreach effort to the public and politicians &ndash; otherwise, fire program could get cut
<ul>
<li>Fire program severely tested from an escaped prescribed burn in November 2011 that destroyed 32 houses
<ul>
<li>Part of Reason Rick retired</li>

</li>
<li>The first instance of home loss from a DEC burn in 50 years</li>
<li>More stringent risk management assessment of the program occurred</li>
<li>Despite community anxiety, support for continuation of extensive prescribed burn program remains high (similar to Florida from home losses 5 years ago)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These are mature programs, California is in the beginning and we will need patience and the support from the public and politicians</li>
<li>We will have problems: Indigenous fire use could help us move forward</li>
<li>Hopefully can learn from them and build a program</li>

<li>Paiute Forestry was an offensive term that was directed at light burning, calling it &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; because tribes practiced it</li>
<li>Stuart Show manipulated data to make burnings look more dangerous</li>
<li>Canopy fires
<ul>
<li>Higher severity &ndash; upper trees aren&rsquo;t fire adapted like the base of trees</li>
<li>Used to be rare pre-1800s, now more common due to build up of surface fuels</li>
<li>Latter fuels allow fire to travel up fuel, up to canopies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clinton Walker was an advocate of light burning</li>
<li>There is little short-term economic gain to do fuel treatment</li>
<li>CA&rsquo;s first governor (Peter Burnett) supported the Native American protection act and endorsed the war of extermination</li>
<li>At least 4.5 million acres were burned annually pre-colonization (1800s)</li>
<li>Ron Good claimed that cultural burning was primarily for cultural reasons + increase value of raw materials and increase visibility</li>

<li>Prescribed fire definition: A wildland fire burning under pre-defined conditions that will accomplish certain planned objectives. Fire is ignited by people by drip torch or helicopter
<ul>
<li>Whereas cultural burnings exist only for cultural reasons</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prescribed burner must integrate:
<ol>
<li>Weather (present day and forecast)
<ul>
<li>Weather has strongest correlation with severity of the fire + it can change rapidly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Topography</li>
<li>Fuels (load, moisture content)
<ul>
<li>Spotting (embers flying across lines) occurs when fuel is very dry</li>

</li>
<li>Ignition patterns (how fair is put on the ground)
<ul>
<li>Art side &ndash; factor you can control</li>
<li>E.x. head fires, backing fires, strip-head fires</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crew size and experience, where to assign people</li>
<li>Safety (highest priority of all fires)</li>
<li>Risk (all fires have risk, goal is to minimize it and have a plan in place to execute if something goes wrong)</li>

<ul>
<li>Compared to SoCal, where practices were banned early on, Karuk and Yurok have more recent information</li>
<li>E.x. Bill Crook learned from his grandma who practiced burns pre-gold rush</li>

<li>Considerable Indigenous Knowledge about Cultural</li>
<li>Longer continuation of burning</li>

<li>USFS
<ul>
<li>Until fairly recently, have not been receptive to Cultural Burning Until fairly recently</li>
<li>Now have Native Californian employees high up in management
<ul>
<li>Can&rsquo;t be about certain people, should be about policy</li>
<li>Otherwise, if these key people retire then we&rsquo;re screwed!</li>

</li>
<li>Integration of TEK and WS (Western Science)

<li>More utilitarian approach &ndash; can be tailored to smaller area to achieve specific outcome</li>
<li>Emphasize Fuel Reduction</li>
<li>Residential Areas (W/U Interface)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TEK: Cultural Burning requires a more nuanced, patch-like approach

<li>Reason: Ama Mutsun have a spiritual obligation from Creator to use fire to take care of ancestral land</li>
<li>Goals: (1) To document, protect, and steward cultural and natural resources, (2) locate areas that may be suitable for landscape revitalization + seed collection</li>
<li>Landscape components: (1) Non-biological = archeological sites, natural springs, viewsheds, salmon spawning habitat (2) biological = vegetation type and ethnobotany</li>
<li>Stratified survey approach: focus on broad areas of flat land near water</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Include survey to detect ancestral archaeological sites
<ul>
<li>High density of ethnobotanical and culturally-important vegetation (seed and nut foods, basketry and crafting taxa, hazelnut patches)</li>
<li>Grasslands being converted to shrublands</li>

</li>
<li>AMLT &ndash; Implemented a Native Nursery and Plant Propagation Program
<ul>
<li>Nursery used to raise thousands of plants identified in eco-arch work
<ul>
<li>Tarweeds, California Brome Grass, California Canary Grass, Red maids, yarrow, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After propagated in the greenhouse, they plants are moved outside to field beds where they&rsquo;re then &ldquo;harvested&rdquo; for their seeds</li>
<li>Enables us to keep rare plants alive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Raise seedlings in nursery
<ul>
<li>Some then planted in fields these provide seeds for restoration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We will use these seedlings and seeds in our revitalization efforts</li>
<li>In Undertaking This Work Hope To Create Fuel Breaks
<ul>
<li>Open Areas &ndash; where we can slow down fire, may not stop major fire but provide where calfire can better manage major fire!</li>
<li>Hope to Construct Patchy Landscape Mosaic across tribal territory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>And if strategically designed and placed, can address three crucial concerns today:
<ol>
<li>Enhance Quantity And Diversity of Indigenous Plants And Animals</li>
<li>Provide Better Food Security For Tribal Members
<ul>
<li>Provide Places for tribal harvesting of native foods, medicines, Dance regalia, raw materials for making baskets, other crafts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create Extensive Fuel Breaks
<ul>
<li>In critical areas on public lands</li>
<li>Help minimize risk of major fires</li>

</h1>
<ol>
<li>As an AC class, a major objective of this course is
to examine diverse populations relationship to fire
in California
<ul>
<li>Today, while most of us fear wildland fires, that has not always been the case;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defining fire regimes for local regions of CA:
<ul>
<li>fire frequency, fire season, fire area, fire severity, interaction with other factors;</li>
<li>Scott’s Discussions of fire regimes for different CA ecosystems</li>
<li>anthropogenic and natural fire regimes;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Long-Term use of fire by Human populations:
<ul>
<li>Important component of human evolution</li>
<li>Constructive use of fire over hundreds of thousands of years for cooking, warmth, ceremonial use, etc.</li>
<li>people bring fire with them when they colonized new landscapes and places across the globe, including California probably 13,000-15,000 years ago;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Historical Fire Ecology:
<ul>
<li>How we study the history of past fire regimes:</li>
<li>Coring lakes to obtain charcoal, pollen, phytoliths</li>
<li>Coring trees</li>
<li>Wedges from trees for fire scar analysis</li>
<li>Other lines of evidence employed: ethnohistorical accounts, ethnography, Native histories (oral traditions)</li>
<li>Eco-archaeology (flotation to recover plant animal remains from archaeological sites)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cultural Burning in California
<ul>
<li>California Indians have lived here more than 13,000 years</li>
<li>Traditionally referred to as “Hunter-Gatherers” in anthropology literature,” but best to Refer to Them as “Resource Managers or Landscape Stewards”;</li>
<li>Reasons for anthropogenic fires (control pests, remove detritus, open pathways, hunting, habitat revitalization to facilitate growth of tribal foods, medicines, dance regalia, raw materials)</li>
<li>Regular, small-scale burning to enhance productivity, diversity, and sustainability of habitats – produce patchy mosaics</li>
<li>Holocene times – California characterized byanthropogenic landscape, not “Pristine Wilderness”</li>
<li>Controversy about scale and timing of anthropogenic/cultural burning:</li>
<li>Central California – evidence for creation of coastal prairies by people 800-1400 CE (Rob Cuthrell, Valentin Lopez – eco-arch Research);</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transformations with Colonialism:
<ul>
<li>Significant impacts of Spanish, Russian, Mexican, and American (settler) colonization: altered fire regimes</li>
<li>environmental degradation</li>
<li>genocide of Native peoples</li>
<li>Loss of land</li>
<li>few reservations granted – mostly very small in size</li>
<li>many tribes not federally recognized</li>
<li>detrimental impacts of fire exclusion and later fire suppression</li>
<li>Termination of Indigenous landscape stewardship practices on any major scale, but timing varied across state depending on history of colonization</li>
<li>Some loss of Traditional Ecological Knowledge</li>
<li>TEK (Val Lopez);</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Advent of Fire Suppression:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Debate about “Light Burning” in 1880s-early 1900s
<ul>
<li>use of fire by sheep herders and by timber companies</li>
<li>establishment of Forest Reserves, USFS (1905)</li>
<li>influence of Gifford Pinchot (trained in Europe as discussed by Jameson Karns)</li>
<li>Light Burning loses out to total fire suppression</li>
<li>influence of 1910 Great Idaho Fire and other factors discussed by Scott</li>
<li>fire suppression really develops in WWII and Post-war years</li>
<li>Smokey the Bear, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=8>
<li>Impact of Fire Suppression on local Ecosystems:
<ul>
<li>Fire suppression methods very effective: 98-99% of fires out at less than 5 acres in size</li>
<li>Major implications for taking fire out of ecosystem: increase fuel loads (ladder, surface, crown fuels), increase density of vegetation, fewer open areas, vegetation that is more homogeneous, encroachment of shrubs and trees, loss of grasslands, meadows, spring (Scott, Brandon Collins)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start=9>
<li>Post-Suppression Times:
<ul>
<li>Importance of Leopold Report in 1963 for National Parks and otherfederal and state agencies</li>
<li>USFS, NPS and others</li>
<li>experiment with prescribed burning, managed fires, and various fire proxy methods, including manual thinning, mechanized removal of vegetation, etc. (Jim Agee, Jan van Wagtendonk)</li>
<li>In regard to prescribed burning, California nowhere near what Florida does. Much more needs to be done here!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tribal Revitalization in California
- important concern of Tribes: Health of Environment, work to bring back Indigenous Stewardship Practices
- ecological restoration of Tribal Lands
- push to bring Cultural Burningand other stewardship practices back to the land: Five Case studies discussed: Timbisha Shoshone (Death Valley)
- Chumash (Santa Barbara)
- North Fork Mono Tribe (southern Sierra Nevada Mts.)
- Karuk And Yurok Tribes (Northwest California)
- Amah Mutsun Tribal Band (Central Coast of California);</li>
<li>The Future: Rethinking how we manage open spaces, public lands, wildland/urban Interface in California:
<ol>
<li>Use of Managed Fires where possible (Yosemite Case Study)</li>
<li>Need much more prescribed burning to reduce fuel loads, develop fuel breaks, forest restoration, etc. Also employ manual thinning and mechanized vegetation removal when burning not a viable option;</li>
<li>Need to bring back Indigenous landscape management practices, including strategic use of Cultural Burning (more nuanced treatment of specific resources)
<ul>
<li>Create partnerships with Tribes and Federal and State Agencies</li>
<li>Can we combine prescribed burning and cultural Burning in some areas of California? We think so and are working on it&mldr;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proposal: Establish a Stewardship Corps for California that is dedicated to active ecosystem management
<ul>
<li>Implement programs for training and certifying prescribed burn managers (like Florida)</li>
<li>Fund stewardship corps work throughout year (prescribed/cultural burns in winter, spring, late fall)</li>
<li>Create local/regional stewardship districts where corps undertakes regular maintenance of the land (like painting the Golden Gate Bridge) &ndash; tailored to specific local ecosystems</li>
<li>Composition of stewardship corps would include people from local tribes and members of local communities – create career Opportunities;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New policies and regulations: fire insurance, zoning issues (try to decrease further development in Wildland/Urban Interface?)
<ul>
<li>Mandate good building codes to fire-proof homes and surroundings – especially after major fires</li>
<li>improve electrical infrastructure of California</li>
<li>advocate for more community participation to prepare for fires</li>
<li>increase funding for UC Extension to work with communities to better prepare for fires;</li>
</ul>
