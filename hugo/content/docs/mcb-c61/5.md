# 16: Skin, Touch, and Movement

- Somatosensory receptors occur in the skin
    - Dorsal-root ganglion (DRG) is a somatosensory neuron that carries 'touch' information
- Somatosensory cortex is where information is processed
    - Located in postcentral gyrus
    - Somatosensory body map pairs region in cortex and location on body
        - Discovered by Wilder Penfield
        - Size in cortex isn't 1:1 with size (index finger has an extra-large area)
            - "Distortion" reflects sensory sensitivity
            - E.x. difficult to sense two points of contact (on back); Two-point discrimination test
        - Finger amputation in monkey increased cortical response for adjacent fingers (somatosensory map reorganization)
            - Phantom limb's may occur when one loose's their arm and 'feels' said arm when receives information from cortical-adjacent areas
    - Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) lesions lead to loss of sensation in specific region
    - Posterior somatosensory cortex (S2, S3, etc) lesions lead to neglect syndrome: one is aware, but unable to focus on a body region (ex. one doesn't dress their left-side of their body)
- Primary motor cortex (M1)
    - Located anterior to the postcentral gyrus
    - Contains a motor-body map
        - Contralateral; left-right, right-left
    - Supplementary motor / premotor areas: Involves planning of movement; lesions cause apraxias, impairment in organizing movements (to solve problems)
    - Mirror neurons activate during _movement_ and during _observation_ of movement!
        - Vast interconnectivity between posterior sensory areas and prefrontal motor areas
- Cerebellum
    - Involved in timing and coordination of movement
    - More nerve cells here than the rest of the brain
- Frontal-parietal lesion
    * Causes paralysis of right half of body
    * Lead to loss of sensation, 'weirdness' on right side
    - If on the right side, they become denial!
        - Anosognosia, loss of knowledge of one's disease
        - Exhibits a kind of exaggeration of psychological defenses
        - Hypothesis: Left hemisphere controls defense mechanisms and is kept in check by the right hemisphere


# 17: Imaging the Brain

<!-- - Lesion: stroke, tumor, traumatic injury, disease -->
## Static/structural brain imaging:
> Popularized by Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) in De Humani Corporis Fabrica (1543)
- X-ray imaging
    - Discovered by William Rontgen in 1895
    - First Nobel Prize in Physics (1901)
    - Xrays are higher energy than UV and natural light, passing through skin/tissue more-so than bone
    - Lesions show as change in contrast
- Computed axial tomography (CAT, CT)
    - Began in 1970s
    - [16A](../eecs-16a/1.md)
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
    - Looks similar to CAT scan
    - Operates by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to measure/alter the nuclear spin of atoms in molecules
    - Magnetic field strength:
        - Tesla = 10,000 Gauss
        - Earth's magnetic field = 0.5 gauss
    - No known toxic effects on the body

## Dynamic/functional brain imaging

- Electroencephalography (EEG)
    - Developed in 1920s by Hans Berger
    - Give's you a 'summed' signal of the brain
        - Seizure causes erratic behavior
    - Wilder Penfield, epileptogenic tissue
- Electrocorticography (ECoG)
    - Temporary implanted electrodes on brain itself
    - Allows higher frequency range + higher resolution
- Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
    - Magnetic fields are far weaker, so a stronger detector is needed
    - Very expensive and can only operate in special, shielded room
- fMRI
    - Hemoglobin: Protein in our red blood; has spin-flip energy depending on oxygen contents
    - BOLD signal: Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Signal
        - Represents changes in (de)oxygenated hemoglobin from blood flow and cell metabolism
        - Correlated with neural activity
- Positron emission tomography (PET)
    - Radioactive isotope injected into blood; Florine-18 (HL: 2hr), Oxygen-15 (HL: 2min), Carbon-11 (HL: 20min)
        - These unstable elements emit positrons (anti-electron): the antimatter particle corresponding to the electron
        - Matter-antimatter collision results in annihilation: complete conversion of mass to energy
        - 2 gamma-ray photons released when positron-electron collision occur
    - Enables 3d reconstruction of where most energy is occurring (glucose intake, directly)
    - Only difference/change in brain activity is shown
        - “dark energy” of the brain is the abnormally large background noise
- Ernest Lawrence invented, at Berkeley, the Cyclotron in the 1930s
    - Accelerates atoms to very high speeds
    - Won Nobel Prize in 1939 in Physics
    - Transuranium elements 104-118 found by Russians
        - Live for a fraction of a second
    * Able to create unstable elements, required in PET scans


# 18: Connectivity, Language, and Meaning

- Aphasia:
    - Broca’s;
        - Left frontal lobe
        - Production aphasia for spoken and written language
        - Mouth/tongue etc are all uneffected
    - Wernicke’s:
        - Comprehension aphasia for spoken and written language
            - Prevent analysis at a higher level
        - Part of auditory cortex
<!-- - Broca’s area, Wernicke’s area -->
- Cortical layers and connectivity
- Hemispheric asymmetry
- Wada test:
    - Bartbiturate sedative-hypnotic injected into right/left hemisphere
        - via right/left catheter threaded from femoral artery in thigh
    - Asked to count after injection
        - Right causes slight pause when it hits
        - Left causes speaking to stop when it hits
- Language lateralization and handedness
    - Right handers: LH 97%; RH 3%
    - Non-right handers: LH 70%; RH 15%; Both 15%
- Linguistic mirror neurons
    - Sound activate the auditory cortex, A1
    - Sounds that are clearly language activate A1, Wernicke's
    - Language with meaning activates A1, Wernicke's, Broca's
    * Language occurs all across the brain
        * Origin of intentionality isn't real clear
        * Prefrontal motor areas generate movement
