# 4: Genes and the History of Molecular Biology

## Overview of History

* Mid-1850s:
    * **Charles Darwin** proposes that all life is deeply related and that there must be some underlying source of variation that is associated with how information is stored and passed on from one generation to the next.
    * **Gregor Mendel** investigates inheritance in pea plants, which leads to the idea that information needed to build an organism is packaged into a **gene** -- some abstract kind of units associated with specific traits, segregated and sorted in reproduction
* 1920s: Based on groundwork laid by **Max Planck** in 1900 and **Albert Einstein** in 1905, a large group of physicists begin to develop Quantum Mechanics.
* 1932: **Niels Bohr** speaks to a group of clinicians in Copenhagen, Denmark, about the limits of investigating structure and function of living organisms at the subcellular level; he speculates that such study could kill the cell.
* 1935: **Max Delbrück** publishes “On the nature of gene mutation and gene structure,” in which he proposes that genes are likely to be large molecules. In 1937 he moves to the United States and begins working with bacteria and viruses (called “bacteriophages”) as a way to investigate the physical properties of heredity.
    * Viruses are simple--consisting of protein, nucleic acid, and lipid--yet carry genes to replicate themselves
* 1944:
    * **Erwin Schrödinger** publishes What Is Life?, dealing with deep questions concerning the molecular basis of life and drawing attention to Delbrück’s idea that genes are likely to be large molecules. His book inspires a signiﬁcant number of physicists to research the physical basis of life, a ﬁeld of study that eventually becomes called molecular biology.
    * **Oswald Avery** and colleagues publish a report that describes experiments with pneumococcal bacteria demonstrating that DNA can carry genetic information from one cell to another. The report concludes “a nucleic acid of the deoxyribose type is the fundamental unit of the transforming principle” (not protein). His work was essentially ignored by the scientiﬁc community, which considered DNA too “stupid” a molecule to carry genetic information.
* 1952: **Alfred Hershey** and **Martha Chase** infect bacteria with T2 phages containing radioactive sulfur atoms (incorporated into protein) and radioactive phosphorous atoms (incorporated into DNA) and showed that it is the radioactive DNA that is transferred to the bacteria during viral infection (more below)
* 1953: **Francis Crick** and **James Watson** propose their famous double-helical structure for the DNA molecule.
    * Realized that **genes** where sequences of (A,T,C,G)s in DNA and that there was some genetic code between this DNA sequence and the ammino acids in proteins

### The Hershey-Chase Blender Experiment

* Sought to answer the question: Are Genes Made of Protein or DNA?
* Steps involved:
    1. Bacteriophage virus T2 is grown on two different media: one containing radioactive sulfur atoms and one containing radioactive phosphorus atoms.
        - Most proteins contain sulfur atoms, while DNA does not; DNA contains phosphorus atoms, while proteins do not.
    2. The viruses are allowed to infect bacteria in a solution with it's genes, but not given enough time to replicate.
    3. The cells are agitated (bended) enough to dislodge the virus particles from the surface of the bacteria.
    4. Spinning in a centrifuge causes the larger, heavier bacteria to settle into a pellet at the bottom of the tube, while the smaller, lighter virus particles remain in the supernatant liquid.
        * Radioactivity remains in the supernatant, and thus protein stays with the original phages after the infection.
        * Radioactivity is in the pellet, and thus DNA is transferred to the bacteria during the infection; thus, Genes are made of DNA.

# 5: How Neurons Generate Signals

- Diffusion
    - Things tend to spread out from high to low areas of concentration
    - With ions, they diffuse as a function attempting to equalize the concentration difference along with the electrostatic attractions/repulsions

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Ion channels proteins:
    - Are often gated, sometimes allowing certain substances through
    - Passive; substances move across membrane down concentration gradient so they do not require energy (unlike pumps)
    - This leads to concentration differences of the major ions for neural function
        - Na+, Cl-, Ca++ tend to be more concentrated on the outside of the neuron
        - K+ tends to be more concentrated on the inside
        - This produces a *resting* potential of -65 millivolts (negative inside) -- when no signals are being sent
- Hyperpolarization: The membrane potential, wrt the resting, becomes more negative when a K+ or Cl- channel open
- Depolarization: The membrane potential becomes more positive when a Na+ or Ca+ enter
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->

{{< /columns >}}
- Axon hillock: where all dendrites meet, where depolarization first occurs
    - Spatial and temporal summation of neuronal input: superposition of signals from dendrites occur
- Action potential: The amount of energy needed for a neuron to fire
    - Research done by Alan Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley
    - Voltage-gated ion channels open and close to create this phenomena
    - Action potential propagation along axon with Na+ entering and K+ exiting
        - Sodium-potassium pumps Na+ out of neuron and K+ into neuron to 'recharge' the neuron
        - This requires energy in the form of ATP
            - 1 ATP => 3 Na+ out / 2 K+ in
            - 25% of our energy  is consumption by human brain
    - Refractory period is the 2-3 ms cooldown where it can't fire again
{{< figure  src="/docs/mcb-c61/apotent.png" >}}
- Myelin coats axons, forming nodes of Ranvier
    - Speeds up propagation via Saltatory conduction
    - Allows the AP to 'jump', increasing up signal speed from 10 m/s to 100 m/s
    - Only in vertebrae animals
    - Made up of 40% phospholipid, 30% cholesterol, 30% protein
    - Forming myelin
        - Oligodendrocytes operates in the central nervous system, working on various axons simultaneously
        - Schwann cells operate in peripheral nervous system

# 6: Synapses, Neurotransmitters, and Receptors

- Electrical synapse
    - Gap junction: where ions flow from one to another
    - Connexons: channel
    - Connexins: subunit
- Chemical synapse:
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Default synapse people reference
- Dendritic spine increase the surface area, act as input channel
- AP propagates down through VG Na+ and K+ channels which trigger the VG Ca++ channels
- Synaptic vesicle then fuse to membrane-to-membrane to terminals which...
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
{{< figure  src="/docs/mcb-c61/cleft.png" >}}
{{< /columns >}}
    - Involve neurotransmitters (e.x. serotonin, dopamine) which release into the synaptic cleft
        - Synaptic cleft is ~20nm between in and output
            - Pre-synaptic neuron: axon terminal
            - Post-synaptic neuron: dendritic spine, dendrite, cell body
    - Reuptake transporter reabsorb the neurotransmitter and repackage/resynthesize them
- Otto Loewi discovered this concept of chemical neurotransmitters
    - Done by triggering the Vagus nerve to slow down a heart in water, then setting another new heart in the same water and finding it slowed down as well
    - Called this Vagusstoff, now known as Acetylcholine
- Two most common neurotransmitters (NTs)
    1. Glutamate: primary excitatory (more positive, gain of ions) NT in human brain
    2. GABA: primary inhibitory NT in human brain
    - Glutamic acid decarboxylase is an enzyme than can convert glutamate to GABA
- Two common receptors
    1. Ionotropic receptor / Ligand-gated channel
        - One type of NT receptor protein
        - NT opens the channel, allowing ions through (Ionotropic)
        - Ligand = small molecule that binds to a larger
        1. Ionotropic glutamate receptors
            - Channels for Na+ and Ca++
            - Produces EPSP: excitatory post-synaptic potential
        2. Ionotropic GABA receptors
            - Channels for Cl-
            - Produce IPSP: inhibitory post-synaptic potential
    2. Metabotropic receptor, GPCR: G-Protein coupled receptor
        - NT trigger the GPCR which activates G-protein which interact with...
        - Effector Enzyme makes cAMP which can interact with..
        - Protein Kinase which activate substrate proteins causing cellular effects
        * This is very complex intracellular messaging
