# 8: Poison, Medicine, and Pharmacology

- Pharmakon: medicine and poison at the same time
    > Everything is a poison. The difference between a poison and a remedy depends on the dose. <br>-- Paracelsus
- Botulinum Toxin
    - Strongest toxin known
    - Disrupts acetylcholine transmitters of neuromuscular junctions
    - Human LD$_{50}$ = lethal dose for 50%: 2 ng / kg
        - E.x. lethal dose for 50kg is 100ng
    - Therapeutic (Botox) dosage: ~5ng
        - Therapeutic Index (TI): lethal dose / therapeutic dose
            - E.x. 100/5 = 20 (unitlest)
- Brain
    - The brain needs lots of energy; makes up ~25% of the body's energy intake at rest
    - The brain receives robust blood flow via the circulatory system
    - Blood-brain barrier (BBB): Everywhere, except the brain and spinal cord, have pores in the blood vessel walls (allowing medium-large molecules system)
        - Walls are composed of phospholipid bilayer biological membrane -- thus most of the thickness is hydrophobic
        - Ways to pass
            1. Transport proteins: glucose sugar, some amino acids (too big for channels)
            2. Diffusion: Sufficiently lipophilic / hydrophobic molecules -- how non-endogenous molecules pass
## Natural poisons

### Tetrodotoxin (TTX)
- Blocks voltage-gated sodium channels
    - Peripheral nerves unable to generate normal action potential
    - Leads to numbness, muscle weakness, paralysis
    - Can lead to death through respiratory paralysis
- Does not get into the brain
- No CNS effects!
- In skin and organs of puffer/blow fish, octopus, newts, fugu
    - All unrelated animals; there are symbiotic bacteria that cause this resistance
- TTX resistance: how do these animals (and their predators) not die?
    - Genetic variance can lead to an amino acid change in the sodium channel
    - Only 1/1800 amino acids are sufficient to be resistant

### Saxitoxin
- Also called Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP)
- Found in dinoflagellates and other protists
- Causes numbness, muscular weakness, paralysis
- Resistance results from mutations in the Sodium channel
    - Mutation changing a single amino acid from glutamic acid to aspartic acid (one carbon difference!) causes 1000x decrease in STX sensitivity

### Batrachotoxins

- Discovered in skins of tiny amazonian frogs
    - Used for blow darts to hunt birds
    - Also found in birds which eat a certain beadle
        - Thought that inside the beadle live symbiotic organisms that produce the molecule
- Paralytic effect
- Rather than blocking VG sodium channels, these trigger the receptors (open) which causes a similar effect
    - Similar to local anesthetics (i.e cocaine, benzocaine, lidocaine, procaine)


## 2 Acetylcholine Receptors

1. Ionotropic (nicotinic ACh receptor)
    - Occurs in brain, neuromuscular junctions
    - Agonists: nicotine
    - Antagonist: tubocurarine
2. GPCR (muscarinic ACh receptor)
    - Occurs in brain, parasympathetic NS
    - Agonists: Muscarine
    - Antagonist: Atropine (parasympatholytic)


<!-- - Atropine, Atropa belladonna -->

# 9: Psychoactive Drugs

## Psychoactive drugs: top 5
1. Caffeine: tea leaves, coffee, chocolate
   - Molecule blocks adenosine receptors (antagonist)
2. Ethyl alcohol: beer, wine
   - From fermentation of sugar by yeast
   - Enhances GABA action at receptors
   - Antagonist at some glutamate receptors
   - Blocks presynaptic uptake of adenosine
   - Most popular _sedative-hypnotic drugs_; those that are calming at lower doses and can lead to death
       - TI is low; ~10 for ethanol
       - Also: Barbiturates (TI <10; used in lethal injection), benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium), general anesthetics (gases; global loss of sensation for surgeries)
       - All enhance inhibitory action of Cl- GABA receptor in CNS
3. Nicotine: tobacco plant
   - Agonist at nicotinic AChRs
   - Found in basal forebrain nuclei
   - CNS effects: stimulation and relaxation
   - PNS effects: partial sympathominetic via facilitation of norepinephrine release
4. Arecoline: betel (areca) nut
   - Similar to nuts/dates
   - Popular in Asia
   - Commonly mixed with betel lea, slaked lime (Calcium hydroxide), spices, and, in India, tobacco
       - Slaked lime enhances psychoactive effects
   - Major psychoactive is Arecoline; muscarinic AChR (GPCR) agonist
   - PNS: Activates parasympathetic NS (parasympathomimetic)
   - CNS: stimulant/relaxant effects, like nicotine
5. Cannabinoids: cannabis
      - Effects
          - Analgesic
          - Anti-inflammatory
          - Muscle relaxant
          - Appetite stimulant
          - Antiemetic
          - Reduces intraocular pressure
          - Anti-seizure
          - Sedative
          - Hypnotic
      - Unique botanical chemistry involving cannabinoids (THC, CBD)
      - Endogenous ligand; Endocannabinoids: Mediate retrograde signal (backwards!)
            1. Anandamide
            2. 2-AG
    - Can cause psychosis

- Erythroxylum coca (cocaine)
    - From leaf to prevent insects from munching (similar to nicotine and caffeine)
    - Acts at norepinephrine (Locus coeruleus) / dopamine (ventral tegmentum, substantia nigra) receptors to prevent reuptake
    - PNS: Norepinephrine; sympathomimetic
    - CNS: stimulant; wakefulness, stamina, appetite suppressant, euphoria
    - Toxicities: sympathetic + CNS overstimulation, addiction
    - Local anesthetic
        - Only occurs at high concentration of substance
        - Disrupts Na+ reuptake
- Amphetamine (adderall) and other stimulants (ritalin, provigil, etc)
    - Act on norepinephrine / dopamine, but make receptors 'leakey'

        - Pupil constriction
    - Friedrich Wilhelm SertÃ¼rner was interested in learning what was inside pharmacy products
        - Extracted opium, founding morphine (~1803)
        - Later the other primary opiod, codeine, was extracted as well
    - Semi-synthetic opioids: synthetic modification of opiates from opium
        - Heroin from morphine; 2-3x more potent
    - Synthetic opioids: not directly related to morphine in chemical structure
        - Fentanyl; 100x more potent
        - Wildnil; 10,000x -- used to kill large animals
    - Toxicity
        - Depression of respiratory control centers in brainstem
        - Potential OD potential (low TI)
        - High addictive potential
    - Opioid receptors
        - Agonists at opioid receptors (GPCRs: mu, delta, kappa)
        - Naloxone (Narcan) is an antagonist which blocks and reverses the effects of opioid agonists; used for ODs
        - Endorphins are the neurotransmitter involved
- Psychedelics ('mind manifesting'), hallucinogens

# 10: Neural Development and Neuroplasticity

- Neuroplasticity:
    - Structure and function of synapses always is being modified
    - Occurs at all times, prevalent in prenatal development
    - Increases by...
        - Increase amount of NT released
            - Open gates for longer
        - Increase number of pre/post synaptic vesicles
        - Decrease reuptake transporters
- Embryonic Development
    - Process
        - Starts with an egg full of embryonic stem cells
        - Grows into embryonic disc by 2 weeks
        - Neural tube (start of NS) starts to develop by week 3
    - Controlled by genes
- Human genome
    - 23 chromosomes (from parents haploid cells)
    - 3 billion base pairs (ATCGs)
    - 21,000 distinct genes coding for proteins
    - < 2% of human genome code translated for function protein
        - 80% of the remaining 98% is transcribed into RNA
- Cell differentiation is controlled by gene transcription: turning on/off of genes at different times
    - Done via transcription factors and regulatory RNA
    - E.x brain cells start as stem cells, grow into some nervous system neural progenitor cell, then can change into various types of neurons/gilial cells through axon and dendrite branching + forming connections (synaptogenesis)
- Synaptogenesis involves the axon growing tip (growth cone) extending it's 'feelers' (filopodia) outwards
    - Through staining we can see cell's cytoskeleton (made of microtubules and microfilaments) which are very active in this process
    <!-- - Actin, Tubulin -->
    - Roger Sperry speculate there was some feedback so they knew where to go through chemical signals (Chemoaffinity hypothesis)
        - Now recognized as neurotrophins: proteins produced by the body important for cell growth and survival
    - Guidance Factors
        - Initiated by neurotrophin
        - 'Steered' by contact and soluble factors
            - Ephrin receptor interaction can cause either an attraction or repulsive
        - Microtubule is driven outwards while microfilaments communicate
<!-- - Pruning
- Hippocampus -->
