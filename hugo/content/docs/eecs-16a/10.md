## Negative Feedback (NFB)

- The main idea is 'how do we get an op-amp to output a voltage that isn't railing?'
- [Negative feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback) refers to the idea that there is some output amount that is the ideal or intended amount
    - If the actual amount becomes larger than this reference, then the system must detect this deviation and bring it down to the reference.
    - Similarly, if the actual amount drops too low, the system must bring it back up to the reference.
- [Negative-feedback amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative-feedback_amplifier) helps maintain the output voltage at a constant level despite the fact that the op-amp wants to rail the output.

> To incorporate negative feedback into our op-amp design, we must create a connection that goes from the output into the negative input
{{< /columns >}}
    - So when $V_{in} \in [V_{SS}, V_{DD}]$ we get a non-clipped output
        - Therefore, it's common to omit the supply terminals when the op-amp is in negative feedback
        - When the op-amp is acting as a comparator (i.e. not in negative feedback) the output voltage is basically always either $V_{DD}$ or $V_{SS}$
        - However, when an op-amp is in negative feedback, the output voltage is generally independent of the supply
            - We are implicitly stating that the supply voltages are large enough that we never clip
    - That is, when negative feedback is applied around an amplifier with high [open-loop gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-loop_gain) it  reduces the overall gain of the complete circuit to a desired value due to the [loop gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_gain)
        - [Summary of terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative-feedback_amplifier#Summary_of_terms)


### Checking for NFB

>One convenient method is to check what happens if the output voltage happens to fluctuate by a little bit above the desired output; when this change occurs and propagates back to the input of the op-amp, does it cause the output to come back down to the desired level? If so, the system is in negative feedback.

1. Zero out all independent sources as in Thevenin-Norton Equivalencies
    - Voltage sources become wires and current sources become open circuits
2. "Dink" the output
    - If in NFB and $V_{out} \uparrow$, then $U_- \uparrow$ and $U_+ - U_- \downarrow$ (the difference between the higher and lower voltages decreases if the lower voltage increases.)
    - Then, $A(U_+ − U_−) \downarrow$ also. From this, we can directly say that $V_{out} \downarrow$
    - That is, an increase in the output voltage ultimately led to a decrease in the output voltage.
- [Example on page 3](https://eecs16a.org/lecture/Note19.pdf#page=3)

## Golden Rules

### 1: $i_- = i_+ = 0$
> No current flows in/out of the input terminals $U_-$ and $U_+$
- For ideal op-amps, regardless of NFB
- Thus, the behavior of the input terminal's circuits shouldn't change

### 2: $U_- = U_+ \iff$ NFB
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- That is, the voltage potential at the positive input terminal (relative to ground) and the voltage at the negative input terminal (relative to the same ground) are the same
- Intuitively, the "error signal" going into the op amp must be zero
- Implied by $A \to \infty$, full proof on [page 7](https://eecs16a.org/lecture/Note18.pdf#page=7)

<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
$$\begin{aligned}
v_{in} - f v_{out} &= v_c \\\
v_{out} &= A v_c   \\\
\Longrightarrow v_{out} &= \frac{A}{1+Af}v_{in}  \\\
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, $v_{in} = 0V \implies v_c = 0V$ and $v_{out}$ can be non-zero even when $v_c = 0$ given $A = \infty$

## Signals vs. Supply Voltages

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- In real systems, voltages are typically fluctuating signals
    - e.x. changes in light intensity or electrical brain activity read from an EEG
- Signals are voltages, they are different from the supply voltages of an op-amp because they are typically much smaller and they change over time
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
>To distinguish, we will use the following symbol to represent time-varying voltage signals:
>![](/docs/eecs-16a/10/sig.png)
{{< /columns >}}
- Note that while we are alright having signals as our inputs to op-amps, voltage signals generally should not be used for power since they'd create time-varying behavior

## Loading

> **[Loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_load)**: an electrical component or portion of a circuit that consumes (active) electric power

- The loading effect makes it hard to design circuits because they mean that components will behave differently depending on what they're connected to
    - Specifically, if the circuit afterwards draws current through some element's $R_{el}$, then the output voltage drops.
    - Furthermore, the amount it drops also depends on the rest of the circuit's resistance $R_{th}$ -- but we don’t want to have to redesign our circuit every time we change $R_{el}$

### Example

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- In the real world, the battery (voltage source) has some [parasitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism#Etymology), [**internal resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_resistance) along with the wires -- $r$
- Thus, the voltage drop across the bulb depends on the value of $r$, which is determined by the battery’s internal structure
- Current flows in this circuit, so some of the battery’s voltage is lost to the internal resistance of the battery
    - Most of the time this just means the battery/wires heat up
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
$$V_{lightbulb} = \frac{R_l}{R_l + r} V_{battery}$$
![](/docs/eecs-16a/10/load.png)
{{< /columns >}}
- We want some way to ensure that no matter what $r$ is, the voltage dropped across the bulb was a constant, _isolating_ it from the source


## Buffering

> **[Buffer (amplifier)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_amplifier)**: provides electrical impedance transformation from one circuit to another, with the aim of preventing the signal source from being affected by whatever currents (or voltages, for a current buffer) that the load may be produced with

- Buffers are a powerful tool because they allow us to split circuits into blocks that we can analyze separately and then combine later
- When circuit blocks behave the same way regardless of what they’re are connected to, we don’t need to worry about what’s inside, making it much easier to design complex circuits.

### Example

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- We can throw a **unity gain buffer** in our situation above to solve our issue
    - In a unity gain buffer, $v_{in} = v_{out}$
- The voltage at the non-inverting input is $V_{bat}$ since no current can flow into the op-amp ([GR#1](10.md#1-i_---i_--0)) and the same voltage appears at the output because of our unity-gain buffer
    - This is the case if, by Ohm’s law, current must flow out of the op-amp-- which is perfectly fine since it’s only the inputs that current cannot flow into or out of.
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
$$V_{lightbulb} = U_{out} = V_{battery}$$
![](/docs/eecs-16a/10/unity.png)
{{< /columns >}}

- Now the full $V_{bat}$ will be dropped across the bulb, and we don’t need to worry about any loading effects
    - No matter what the $r$ or $R$ values are, the circuit’s behavior is consistent


## Design Procedure

### 1: Specification
> Concretely restate the goals for the design.
- Frequently, a design prompt will include a lot of text, so we’d like to restate all of the most important features of our design. We’ll refer to these specifications later to determine if our design is complete.

### 2: Strategy

> Describe your strategy (often in the form of a block diagram) to achieve your goal.
- To do this, start by thinking about what you can measure vs. what you want to know
    - For example in our capacitive touchscreen, we want to know if there is a touch and we can measure voltage.
    - Since we know that a touch can change the capacitance, we break this down into the following block diagram:
![](/docs/eecs-16a/10/cap.png)

### 3: Implementation

> Implement the components described in your strategy.
- This is where pattern matching is useful: remind yourself of blocks you know, (ex. voltage divider, inverting amplifier) and check if any of these can be used to implement steps of your strategy.

### 4: Verification

> Check that the design from 3 does what we specified in 1
- Check block-to-block connections, as these are the most common point for problems.
- Does one block load another block causing it to behave differently than expected?
- Are there any contradictions (ex. a voltage source with both ends connected by a wire, or a current source directed into an open circuit)?
