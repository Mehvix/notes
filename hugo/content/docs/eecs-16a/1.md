## Upper Triangular Systems

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Consider the following equation
$$x-y+2z=1$$
$$y-z=2$$
$$z=1$$
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
...which can be represent as
$$\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & -1 & 2 & \text{|} & 1\\\ 
    0 & 1 & -1 & \text{|} & 2\\\ 
    0 & 0 & 1 & \text{|} & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$
{{< /columns >}}
- These are called [upper triangle matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix) -- they are nice in that they're easy to solve!
    - The solution is reached when the diagonal is all one, the remaining is zero (excluding the rightmost 'answer' colum)
- More precisely, a matrix is in [row echelon form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_echelon_form) when the following criteria are met:
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
* All nonzero rows are above all zero rows.
* The leading coefficient of a non-zero row is always to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above it.
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
$$\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & * & * & * & \text{|} & *\\\ 
    0 & 1 & * & * & \text{|} & *\\\ 
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \text{|} & *\\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \text{|} & 0\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$
{{< /columns >}}
    * The leading coefficient of every non-zero row (which we call the pivot, and say is in the pivot position) is 1.
       - Some textbooks will require this third property, others don't
- In addition to row echelon form, there is also reduced row echelon form. 
    - This requires that: In addition, after the upwards propagation of variables in step (3), we will obtain a matrix with the following properties, in addition to the two mentioned above:
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
1. The matrix is in row echelon form.
2. The leading coefficient of every non-zero row (which we call the pivot, and say is in the pivot position) is 1.
3. Each column with an element that is in the pivot position of some row has 0s everywhere else.
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
$$\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & 0 & * & 0 & \text{|} & *\\\ 
    0 & 1 & * & 0 & \text{|} & *\\\ 
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \text{|} & *\\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \text{|} & 0\\\
\end{bmatrix}$$
{{< /columns >}}
    - Sometimes abbreviated (especially in programming) as `rref`.
    - By construction, the Gaussian elimination algorithm always results in a matrix that is in reduced row echelon form. 
        - Once an augmented matrix is reduced to reduced row echelon form, variables corresponding to columns containing leading entries are called **basic variables**, and the remaining variables are called **free variables**
    - As will be discussed shortly, the distinction between basic and free variables allows us to characterize all solutions to the system of linear equations (if any exist!).


{{< expand "Example" >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
We start with the following system:
$$x-y+2z=1$$
$$2x+y+z=8$$
$$-4x+5y = 7$$
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
...which we can write as a matrix
$$\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & -1 & 2 & \text{|} & 1\\\ 
    2 & 1 & 1 & \text{|} & 8\\\ 
    -4 & 5 & 0 & \text{|} & 7
\end{bmatrix}$$
{{< /columns >}}
...and we can **row-reduce** to upper triangle (Row echelon)
<!-- - add .$-2 (1)$ to row two and .$4 (1)$ to row three 
$$\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & -1 & 2 & \text{|} & 1\\\ 
    2-(2\cdot 1) & 1-(2\cdot -1) & 1-(2\cdot 2) & \text{|} & 8-(2\cdot 1)\\\ 
    0 & 1 & 8 & \text{|} & 11
\end{bmatrix}$$-->

...which we can use [**back substitution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix#Forward_and_back_substitution) to solve

- In real systems, we will always have noise (error) that makes our systems slightly skewed
    - So what if we repeat the example above, but have a measurement of .$+0.1$... are there any solutions?

- We can represent our solution as a set of linear equations, meaning we can represent them graphically
