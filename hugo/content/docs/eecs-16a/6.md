# 03-01: Voltage Dividers


## Voltage Divider

- The [voltage divider circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider) consists of a voltage source (.$V_S$) and two resistors (.$R_1$ and .$R_2$)
- Example: 
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
1. We label the node connected to the voltage supply as .$u_1 (= V_S)$, since the voltage supply goes between this node and ground.
2. Label the remaining node as .$u_\text{mid}$ and the voltages and currents through every element in the circuit with .$V_i$ and .$I_i$ respectively
3. Write KCL equations for all nodes with unknown voltage - in this case, this is just .$u_\text{mid}$, since .$u_1 = V_S$. 
    - The current entering that node is .$I_{R_1}$ and the current leaving it is .$I_{R_2}$
    - Since these currents must be equal, .$I_{R_1} = I_{R_2}$

    4. Find expressions for element currents for all elements (except the voltage source) -- all steps on [page 3](https://eecs16a.org/lecture/Note12.pdf#page=3)
        {{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
$$I_{R_1} = \frac{V_S - u_\text{mid}}{R_1}$$
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
$$I_{R_2} = \frac{u_\text{mid}}{R_2}$$
{{< /columns >}}
    5. Substitute the element currents into our KCL equation. We have
        $$I_{R_1} = I_{R_2} \Longrightarrow \frac{V_S - u_\text{mid}}{R_1} = \frac{u_\text{mid}}{R_2}$$
    7. Solve the above equation. Rearranging, we find that
        $$V_S R_2 −u_\text{mid}R_2 = u_\text{mid}R_1$$
        $$ \Longrightarrow u_\text{mid}(R_1 +R_2) = V_SR_2$$
        $$ \Longrightarrow u_\text{mid} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} V_S = \frac{1}{1+ \frac{R_1}{R_2}} V_S = \alpha V_S$$
    {{< hint "info" >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
The reason this circuit is called a "voltage divider" is that _we can create any output voltage_ of .$u_\text{mid} = \alpha V_S$ for any .$\alpha \in [0,1]$ (assuming that all of the resistance values are non-negative) by varying the ratio of the resistor values .$R_1/R_2$. As we will see shortly, varying this ratio is exactly the mechanism we will use to convert the relative position of a user’s touch to a voltage.
    {{< /hint >}}

{{< hint "info" >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
.$R_2$, the **resistor in the numerator**, is the one next to ground. .$R_1$ is connected to a non-zero  voltage node (in this case .$u_1 = V_S$).

- Power refers to the rate of energy change, .$P = \frac{dE}{dt} \text{ [Watts]}$
    - .$\dots \Longrightarrow dE = V\ dQ \Longrightarrow \frac{dE}{dt} \equiv P = V \frac{dQ}{dt} = VI$
        - .$P_\text{el} = I_\text{el} \cdot V_\text{el} = V^2_\text{el} \cdot R^{-1}_\text{el} = I^2 _\text{el} R _\text{el}$
    - $P > 0 \implies$ (positive) power _dissipated_, negative power _generated_.
        - By [PSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_sign_convention), resistors always dissipate power because current enters the .$+$ terminal
        - Voltage sources tend to generate power, since current comes out of the .$+$ terminal (and the product .$P = IV < 0$)
    - $P < 0 \implies$ (positive) power _generated_, negative power _dissipated_.
    - In an [isolated (circuit) system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_system), the sum of the power (across all components) should equal zero by conservation of energy
        - Useful sanity-check
- .$R = \rho \frac{L}{A}$

## Touchscreen

![](/docs/eecs-16a/6/touch.png)

- Given that the top (red) layer has a resistivity .$\rho$ and a cross-sectional area .$A$, the resistance of the top layer from the touchpoint to the right-hand end is given by .$R_1 = \rho \frac{L_\text{rest}}{A}$, the resistance of the top layer from the left-hand end to the touchpoint is given by .$R_2 = \rho \frac{L_\text{touch}}{A}$
- We can see that .$u_\text{mid}$ can be found because it's a voltage divider:
    $$u_\text{mid} = \frac{\rho \frac{L_\text{touch}}{A}}{\rho \frac{L_\text{rest}}{A} + \rho \frac{L_\text{touch}}{A}}V_S = \frac{L_\text{touch}}{L_\text{touch} + L_\text{rest}}V_S = \frac{L_\text{touch}}{L}V_S$$
    - .$L = L_\text{touch} + L_\text{rest}$: The length of the touchable portion of the screen 
> The relationship we have found between .$u_\text{mid}$ and .$V_S$ is very convenient because .$u_\text{mid}$ is not dependent on any material property such as .$\rho$ and .$A$. This means that the top layer can be built with any material and the relationship between .$u_\text{mid}$ and .$V_S$ is still valid. There are always some non-idealities in the world -- by making .$u_\text{mid}$ independent of any material property, we can make the circuit model immune to such non-idealities. We also have the freedom to choose a material for the top layer that is good for display purposes (rather than needing a specific material for the touchscreen to work).

## Measuring a Circuit

> The voltmeter measures voltage across the circuit, while the ammeter needs to be put in-line with the circuit so that the current flows through the ammeter. 

- **The measurement should not change the energy of the circuit**
    - It turns out that the most complete and concise way of guaranteeing these measurement tools do not influence the circuit is to state that **they do not allow any power dissipated through the measurement device.**


### Voltmeter

Because our [voltmeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltmeter) is made to measure voltage, we can naturally assume that the .$V \neq 0$; this means that a voltmeter must have .$I = 0$ going into it to ensure .$P = IV = 0$.

.$I=0$ occurs when in open-circuits, where exactly zero current is flowing. 


Recall that, for a given voltage, the higher the associated resistance, the lower the current and therefore the lower the dissipated power. That is, .$\lim{R \to \infty} \Longrightarrow I = 0$
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
$$V_\text{el1} = I_\text{meas} R$$
$$V_? - V_\text{el1} - V_\text{meas} = 0$$
$$\Longrightarrow V_? = V_\text{el1} + V_\text{meas}$$
$$\Longrightarrow V_? = I_\text{meas} R + V_\text{meas}$$
$$\therefore V_? = V_\text{meas} \iff I_\text{meas} = 0$$

---

$$I_\text{meas} = \frac{V_\text{meas}}{R_\text{meas}}$$
$$\therefore I_\text{meas} = 0 \iff R_\text{meas} \gg V_\text{meas}$$
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
> Voltmeters are added in **parallel** to the circuit, otherwise they would stop the current from flowing.

### Ammeter

The [ammeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammeter) has the circuit’s current flowing through it. Therefore, to ensure .$P = IV = 0$, the ammeter needs .$V = 0$.

.$V=0$ occurs in short-circuits (ideal wires), where exactly zero potential difference exists

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
$$I_? = I_R + I_\text{meas}$$
$$\therefore I_? = I_\text{meas} \iff I_R = 0$$

---

$$I_R = \frac{V_\text{meas}}{R}$$
$$\therefore I_R = 0 \iff V_\text{meas} = 0$$
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
> Ammeters are added in **series** to the circuit, otherwise they would short-circuit the measured component.
