# 03-01: Voltage Dividers


## Voltage Divider

- The [voltage divider circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider) consists of a voltage source (.$V_s$) and two resistors (.$R_1$ and .$R_2$)
- Example: 
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- We label the node connected to the voltage supply as .$u_1 (= V_S)$, since the voltage supply goes between this node and ground.
- Label the remaining node as .$u_\text{mid}$ and the voltages and currents through every element in the circuit with .$V_i$ and .$I_i$ respectively

    - Write KCL equations for all nodes with unknown voltage - in this case, this is just .$u_\text{mid}$, since .$u_1 = V_S$. 
        - The current entering that node is .$I_{R_1}$ and the current leaving it is .$I_{R_2}$
        - Since these currents must be equal, .$I_{R_1} = I_{R_2}$
    - Find expressions for element currents for all elements (except the voltage source) -- all steps on [page 3](https://eecs16a.org/lecture/Note12.pdf#page=3)
        {{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
$$I_{R_1} = \frac{V_s - u_\text{mid}}{R_1}$$
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
$$I_{R_2} = \frac{u_\text{mid}}{R_2}$$
{{< /columns >}}
    - Substitute the element currents into our KCL equation. We have
        $$I_{R_1} = I_{R_2} \Longrightarrow \frac{V_s - u_\text{mid}}{R_1} = \frac{u_\text{mid}}{R_2}$$
    - Solve the above equation. Rearranging, we find that
        $$V_s R_2 −u_\text{mid}R_2 = u_\text{mid}R_1$$
        $$ \Longrightarrow u_\text{mid}(R_1 +R_2) = V_sR_2$$
        $$ \Longrightarrow u_\text{mid} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} V_s = \frac{1}{1+ \frac{R_1}{R_2}} V_s = \alpha V_s$$
    {{< hint "info" >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
The reason this circuit is called a "voltage divider" is that we can create any output voltage of .$u_\text{mid} = \alpha V_s$ for any .$\alpha \in [0,1]$ (assuming that all of the resistance values are non-negative) by varying the ratio of the resistor values .$R_1/R_2$. As we will see shortly, varying this ratio is exactly the mechanism we will use to convert the relative position of a user’s touch to a voltage.
