# Week 1 (January 18 & 20): Introduction to the course. History, Memory, and Racialization

Reading: Tataki, _Strangers from a Different Shore_, Preface and Ch. 1: “From a Different Shore.”

__What is Asian American Studies?__
- Panethnicity
    - "pan" - a conglomeration
    - "ethnicity" - belonging to a social group
    - Panethnic identity example: Asian American
- Panethnicity Cultural Literacy
    - One's competency about their implicit biases

__Reading:__
- Angel Island versus Ellis Island
    - Angel Island was the west coast immigration entry point for people coming from the west (mainly Asian migration)
    - Ellis Island was the entry point for many immigrrants from the east (mainly European)
    > "Multiculuralism was a find of fear and optimism around how we are a very mixed country and what binds us together is this appreciation of different ethnic backgrounds, but we also assimilate under some cultural practice/viewpoint" - Michael Chang

__Ron Tataki on Multiculturalism (side note - "Reasonable minds may differ")__
- What is "epistemology": Theory of knowledge. Asks the question:
    > "How do you know what you know?"

__Race is socially constructed__
- Through history socio-econmic, labor, and capital conflicts
- Any type of social norm is dependent upon contestation between people in the majority and minority. The power is _asymmetric_: Majority > Minority.

__Cultual Literacy__
- In studying Asian American history we are learning to understand how we have come to understand American history.
    1. What are the source we have been taught?
    2. What are the viewpoints presented in the curriculum we have been taught as history?
    3. How do we believe in _cultural literacy, in that we are literate_ in a diverse range of viewpoints representing the true multicultural background of the United States?

__Arthur Schlesinger's _The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Country___
- A very different view of multiculturalism:
    - The concern of a "breaking apart" or 'Balkanization' due to conflicts
    - Association with multiculturalism with ethnic conflict
    - Reassertion of national unity around assimilation paradigm
    - The concern of the "race problem."
    - The "American Creed"
    - Schlesinger on "disuniting"

_Two different viewpoints: Ron Tataki and Arthur Schlesinger_

__Discussion Questions:__
- Takaki’s formulation of multiculturalism aligns with the concept of
diversity, equity and inclusion of the 2000’s.
    1. How is Diversity related to multiculturalism?
    2. What does the term "American Exceptionalism" mean to you?
        - _Schlesinger was a proponent of “American Exceptionalism” the idea that America has provided safe harbor to many different groups of people. And that here in America, class, and lineage are not important._
    3. How do Asian Americans fit into these models of diversity, multiculturalism and "American Exceptionalism"

__Asian Americans fastest-growing electorate__
- A naturalized citizen = someone who immigrated to the U.S. and gained citizenship
> “More than 11 million will be able to vote this year, making up nearly 5% of the nation’s eligible voters (for this analysis, U.S. citizens ages 18 and older). They are also the only major racial or ethnic group in which naturalized citizens – rather than the U.S. born – make up a majority of eligible voters, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data.”
- Many Asian Americans have limited English proficiency
    - _image_

__Aliens Ineligible for Citizenship and the 14th Amendment__
- 1790 Immigrration and Nationality Act (INA): Asian Americans were __restricted from naturalized citizenship__ from 1790 into the 1940s and until the 1950's depending on Asian ethnic groups.
- At the same time the __14th Amendment__ was passed in 1867 as an important legal tool against discrimination by state and local governments.
    - Included an important clause stating that states cannot treat people differently on the basis of race (now it includes gender)
        > "Simply stated, all persons must be treated equally without regard to their race, color, or national origin."
- Legislation in 1965: Effectively ended the immigration restrictions and quotas against many Asian immigrants. Removed race and national origin as a restriction for naturalization.

__As you move through the readings...__
- Consider what "power", "agency" and "contestation" mean in the context of the history that you reading.
- Those who are constructed in history as "minority" also have agency while those with majority power must contend with the contestationo of majority control.
- How did the process occur in the U.S.? What are the legal and socio-cultural institutions and practices that result in a given standard of a moment in time, and in change?

__Racial Formation__
- Michael Omi & Howard Winant, Introduction, _Racial Formation in the United States_. 2014. HO
    - Dynamic-constantly in flux
    - Reproduction of political interests
        - Aligns with the notion that within a diverse society, there will be multiple stakeholders (different groups and persons bringing forth different interests). The social construction around access to property and citizenship.
    - Race is socially constructed: came out from social contestation, geopolitics, etc.
- Racial formation theory explains the fluidity of racial categories and the interest and forces that shape them. These pieces provide historical examples of how “white” identity came to be legally constructed through court cases and through the socio-economic forces supporting these legal outcomes.
    - Do the courts drive the outcome? Legal institions?
    - 1690: the brewing slave trade
    - 1790: contestation around what “white” meant. Before the slave trade was active, the primary source of labor was young Irish women. Came as indentured servants (a form of labor in which a person is contracted to work without salary for a specific number of years). Example of instability around what being “white” meant.
- Sociologists Omi and Winant describe the fluidity of racial constructions over time dependent on political interests and socio-economic forces, as "racial formation."
- What is Omi and Winant's concept of "common sense"?
    - “Common sense” derives from Italian philosopher and political economist Antonio Gramsci’s theories on asymmetry in political power and the interest conflicts that may emerge as a result.
        - I.e. today’s “Common sense” surrounding gender is that gender is a social construct as opposed to one’s sex.
        - Gramsci wrote about hegemony as in “how does power operate when there is one party that maintains much of the mechanisms of culture and state?”
            - You have agency. A consensus that results from an agreement (not so much voluntary, but through negotiation)

__What is a "Race" versus an "Ethnicity"?__
_Consider the challenge of formally categorizing groups:_
- The U.S. Census Bureau uses the term "Hispanis"
    - Who are "Hispanics"?
    - Who ae "Latinos"?
- Is "Asian AMerican" a race descriptor?
- Is "Hmong American" a race or an ethnicity descriptor?

__Taki referred to the popular perception of Asian Americans as:__
1. __Model Minority:__ A trope that gained traction in the 1960s that stresses the prototypical Asian’s high achievement in socioeconomic status and focuses on their culture to explain their “success”; denies racism and other hardships that are experienced by Asian Americans; comparison between one minority group and another
2. __Perpetual Foreigner:__ stereotype in which naturalized and even native-born citizens are perceived by some members of the majority as foreign because they belong to a minority ethnic or racial group.

_Twin pillars of how Asian Americans are constructed_
> How do these sterotypes and categories affect cultural and legal outcomes for Asian Americans?

__The Social Construction of Race__
- The idea that race is socially constructed emerged as a response to the view that race is based on biology
    - What does it mean to say that race is _not_ based on biology? Does it mean that there are no biological or genetic bases to difference?
    - What is the difference between _difference_ and _race_?
    - Blood quantum: the idea that if you have any drop of African American ancestry, in that jurisdiction/state, you are legally classified as black
        - For whites to maintain racial purity, property, power, and __perpetuated the classification/segregation of people on the basis of race__

__Class Question: How has federal jurisdiction driven civil rights protections from the time of early Asian immigrants to the U.S. to the 2020s?__

- For example, the Interstate Commerce Act addressed the problem of railroad monopolies by setting guidelines for how the railroads could do business.

__Insiders and Outsiders__
1. As cited in footnote 4 of the U.S. Supreme Court's _Carolene Products the Tainted Milk_, case:
> “prejudice directed against discrete and insular minorities may call for “more searching judicial inquiry.”
- Ensured that former slave-holding states would abide by this 14th amendment that said that African Americans had to have citizenship rights
- Created a legal authority when the former slave-holding states tried to reinstitute some form of slavery
2. _Racial formation_ construction?

__Sojourners vs. Immigrants__
- Labor and capital interests drove demand for cheap labor during U.S. industrialization

__Push and Pull__
- Geopolitical
- political economic factors

__Alienation of Migration Guangdong Chinese Women sang__
> _Dear husband, ever since you sojourned.
> In a foreign land.
> I've lost interest in all matters.
> All day long, I stay inside the bedroom,
> My brows knitted; ten thousand
> Thoughts bring me endless remorse, in
> Grief, in silence.
> I cannot fall asleep on my lonely pillow._

__1882 Chinese Exclusion Act__
- Racialized labor conflict and competition
- The main landmark that stems from aliens ineligible for citizenship

__Agency, Resistance and Contestation__
- Yick Wo v. Hopkins, USC 1996
    - Provides the basis for the important legal evidence standard of "disparate impact"
    - Supreme Court said that San Francisco zoning law is in violation of the 14th Amendment

__120,000 Americans of Japanese descent on the Western U.S. seaboard were sent to internment camps. 75% of internees were American citizens by birth.__

# Week 2 (January 25 & 27): The racialization of Asian Americans: contemporary images and historical transformations.

Reading: Okihiro, _Common Ground_, Preface & Ch. 2: “White and Black.”

__Class Question:__ Okihiro writes in his preface that his book _Common Ground_ is about the "creation of the American character and subject."

What does he mean by that?
- the social construction of the nation

__Binaries as convenient cognitive and socio-political constructs__

- Binaries offer coherence, especially during times of social upheaval. They preserve rule amidst apparaent chaos, and stability amidst rapid change, such as during the late eighteenth, nineteenth, and twntieth centuries (i.e industrial revolution, enlightenment, romanticism). Those periods of American history occasioned social reconstitutions of geographies, race, gender, sexuality and nationality that helped to define and regulate identities, the state, and the social formation.

__Break out question:__ What are some modern-day binaries and what socio-political institutions or relationships and hierarchies do they support?
- gender norms, environmental conservation, wealth inequality

__What are some binary ideas or myths based on the social construction of an East vs. West divide?__
- Rudyard Kipling _The Ballad of East and West_, 1889
    > Oh,  East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,
    > Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;
    > But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,
    > When two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends of the earth!
    - These poems pervade our perceptions and are descriptors for historical moments in time. They are important signifiers of binaries

__Model Minority vs. Perpetual Foreigner__
- Are these two poles of the social construction of Asian Americans binary?
- How do they serve to construct the "Asian American subject?"

__Korematsu v. United States__
> "In response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, the U.S. government decided to require Japanese-Americans to move into relocation camps as a matter of national security. President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, two months after Pearl Harbor. A Japanese-American man living in San Leandro, Fred Korematsu, chose to stay at his residence rather than obey the order to relocate. Korematsu was arrested and convicted of violating the order. He responded by arguing that Executive Order 9066 violated the Fifth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit affirmed Korematsu's conviction." - Oyez
- __Conclusion:__ The Court ruled against Korematsu. The Court believed that the decision was valid because it was a necessity amid the danger of espionage and sabotage.

__Common ground vs. Margins as the Mainstream__
- Okihiro writes that his book seeks to reject binaries and to advocate for a "open, borderless" common ground" versus his prior argument that the mainstream norms, rights, values of America were created by the margins.
    - meaning that the _margins create the mainstream._

__Race Conscious Judicial Review and Black/White Paradigm__
- Race relations in the United States have rapidly evolved in recent decades however, race scholars often point to a persistent paradigm that views racial difference primarily through the construction of black and white relations.

__Binarism and Black White as a paradigm__
- Okirhiro says that the American race _paradigm_ views race relations in terms of black and white.

__Separate but Equal: _Plessy v. Ferguson_ (1896)__
- Louisiana's _Separate Car Act_ challenged under the 14th Amendment
> "Louisiana enacted the Separate Car Act, which required separate railway cars for blacks and whites. In 1892, Homer Plessy – who was seven-eighths Caucasian – agreed to participate in a test to challenge the Act. He was solicited by the Comite des Citoyens (Committee of Citizens), a group of New Orleans residents who sought to repeal the Act. They asked Plessy, who was technically black under Louisiana law, to sit in a "whites only" car of a Louisiana train...When Plessy was told to vacate the whites-only car, he refused and was arrested...Plessy was convicted." - Oyez
- __Conclusion__: The Court declared the state law constitutional. In essence, segregation did not constitute unlawful discrimination.

__Constructive blacks__
- Law scholar Frank Wu argues that our legal system construes "racial groups as white, blacks, "honorary whites or constructive blacks."
    - What does "constructive" mean?
        - The legal system has treated Asians, mostly as blacks. Applied the same rules to Asians as they would to Blacks.
- He says historically, the U.S. legal system has treated Asians mostly as "constructive blacks."
    - _People v. Hall_, 1854 (CA state court attributed black status to Asians in enforcing a statue (passed by a legislative body) prohibiting the testimony of blacks, reasoning that "blacks" was a generic term for all nonwhites).
    - _Gong Lum v. Rice_, 1927 (USC upheld segregated public schools for Asians connoting no difference between segregation for blacks to those of the "yellow races").

__1790 Immigration and Naturalization Act revisited__
- Held that only "free white persons" of "good moral character" could become naturalized citizens. After the Civil War, African Americans who were former slaves, gained official citizenship status.
    - _Ozawa v. U.S._, 1922 (USC ruled Japanese American were not white for naturalization but lauded performance of white middle class attributes such as attending Cal, Church, and speaking English at home)
    - _U.S. v. Thind._, 1923 (USC ruled Asian Indian Immigrants not white for naturalization, noting that though anthropologists deemed Indians "Aryan" this was not the same in the common sense understanding of a white person)
    - Racial bar for naturalization not lifted until the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952 (McCarran-Walter Act), and abolished the race restriction of the 1790 INA, though it retained a quota system for nationalities and regions.

__Are Asians White or Black?__
___Do the Right Thing_, Spike Lee (1989)__
- Asians as "Middle Man minority"
    - i.e. Your grandparents may have businesses in neighborhoods that are African-American or Latinx that are in the grey-economic zone.
- Asians as Other Non-Whites:

__Social construction of race__
- Systematic racism vs. Individual discrimination
- Rapid change in federal position over a matter of months

__The 1992 Los Angeles Uprising/Riots__[L.A. Burning: The Riots 25 Years Later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCYT9Hew9ZU&t=6s)
- The filmed video of African American Rodney King beating was probably on of the first "viral video" of police excessive force with serious consequences for race relations.
- Days after the videotaped beating of Rodney King, a Korean American grocery shop owner, Soon Ja Dul, shot and killed a 15 year African American who she mistook for stealing, and grabbed her sweater and backpack and Harlins punched her. Soon Ja Dul went behind the counter to retrieve a shotgun and shot Harlins in the back of her head.
- Following the acquittal in April of 1992, of Los Angeles Police Department officers on trial for the beating, Los Angeles experienced six days of civil unrest that resulted in the burning of many businesses, including those in Korea town which is located in and near historically black neighborhoods. The Harlins killing has also been attributed as contributing to civil unrest that occurred after the acquittal.

__Sa I Gu__[Sa I Gu (official full version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UyYj-pR8U&t=2s)
- A very specific view of the 1992 Los Angeles Uprising/Riots from the perspective of (mostly) Korean American women who were shop owners
- __Afterthoughts:__
    - Where do the views of the witnesses in this movie sit?
    - Can we square the views of the Korean American witnesses here with one of diversity and equity?
    - What racial tensions or divides might exist here between KA and African Americans?
    - Is this a race issue or a class issue?
    - Is this a race issue or an immigration issue?

__The Cold War Construction of the Model Minority Myth__
- What does "model minority" mean? [Why Do We Call Asian Americans The Model Minority? | AJ+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrDbvSSbxk8)
- Black/White paradigm:
    - Does the "model minority" stereotype support the black/white paradigm?
    - How does it support an assimilationist paradigm?
- Scholar Robert Lee says that the stereotype supports a view of minorities compliance with "accommodation" to assimilationist and status quo norms rather than militancy.
    - Lee describes this as a "disjuncture between the newly articulated ideals of racial egalitarianism and the practice of racial discrimination" as evidence by the USC's decisions in the Japanese interment cases.

__Disjuncture?__
- What does Lee mean by this disjuncture?
    - How is this supposed "disjuncture" exemplified by Cold War politics?
        - 1966 NYT's Magazine article on "Success Store: Japanese American Style," and in December of that year, "Success Story of One Minority in the U.S."
        - At a similar moment, U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan published the influential _Report on the Black Family_ (1965) which was an attempty to use data and sociological methods to understand poverty and income inequality in the African American community but which used the term "tangle of pathology" and referenced single parent families in the African American community as a source of the generational poverty.
        - How are these relevant to this idea of "disjuncture"?

# Week 3 (February 1 & 3): U.S.-Asia relations and early immigration.

- __Discussion topics:__
    - Were al the national/ethnic groups who are considered "white" today considered "white" in the 1800's?
    - What was the connection between a person's labor/class status and their racial identity according ot Tataki?
    - What does it mean to "perform" a racial identity. Are you just who you are racially?
    - Are race relations in the U.S. based on a black and white framework?
    - How do Asian Americans fit into a black and white framework?
    - How do Asian Americans not fit into a black and white framework?
    - What is legal discrimination?
    - What is "disparate impact" versus "intentional motivation" or "animus"?
    - What is "color-blind" legla doctrine?

- __Overblown with Hope__
    - _Gam Saan_ = "gold mountain"
        - 1848 shortly after the discovery of gold at John Sutter's Mill, a young man in Canton China wrote to his brother in Boston,
        > "Good many Americans speak of California. Oh! Very rich country! I hear good many Americans and Europeans go there. Oh! They find hold very quickly, so I hear ... I feel as if I should like to go there very much. I think I shall go to California next summer"

    - __Immigrant Labor__
        - _Contract Laborers_
            - Emigration brokers representing sugar planters provided "free passage" where immigrants would sign labor contracts with a planter for 5 years with wages, shelter, food and medical care.
        - _Free Laborers_
            - A credit-ticket system,  a broker lends money to a migrant for the ticket for passage. The migrant would pay off the loan with interest out of his earnings in the U.S.

    - __Chung Kun Ai on money lending__
        > "One condition of his loan of $60 was that each borrower was to pay back $120 as soon as he was able to do so. In all, grandfather must have helped 70 young men from our village and nearby villages to migrate to North and South American and also Australia."

    - __Gender and Migrant Labor: Chinese traditional Culture, Labor and Capital Strucutres, Geopolitics, and race__
        - How did traditional Chinese culture affect the gender demographics of Chinese labor migrants?
            - the wife was in a subordinate positon
            - the wife served as an incentive for their husband to return

    - __Hawaii vs. U.S. Mainland__
        - Hawaii encouraged the husband to bring their families over, whereas the U.S. Mainland (California) only wanted the men.

    - __Complexity in Chinese immigrants__
        1. Hakka did not practice footbinding
        2. Hawaii made some efforts to promote migration of Chinese women.

- __"A Race so Different from Our Own"__
        - Justice Harlan, dissenting, [_Plessy v. Ferguson_](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/163us537)

- __Segregation under the law__
    - Citizenship Rights are the primary pivot for access to recognition by government and thus rights attached to citizenship
    - Segregation upheld only _separation_ but negative status associated with slavery
    - [Randall Kennedy on One Drop Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR3Sw085Bhg) and the complexity of Black identity

- __Early Segregation Historical Milestones__
    - __1790:__ Immigration and Naturalization Act

    - __1896:__ Plessy v. Ferguson

- [__Dred Scott v. Stafford__ (1857)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/60us393)
    - The Court denies citizenship on the basis of deference to the political branches.
    - Pre-Civil War the Supreme Court reified negative status of Blacks
    - Court holds Blacks are not citizens and are thus subject to legislative laws on slaves as chattel (property)

- [__Plessy v. Ferguson__](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/163us537)
    - A legal caste system based on race is created on a fiction of separate but equal.
    - Post-Civil War Supreme Court, holds that segregation of African Americans and Whites does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.  Harlan’s Dissent raises the contradiction of assumedly not segregating Chinese who are excluded from naturalized citizenship while segregating of African Americans who “fought for the union.”

- [__Yick Wo v. Hopkins__](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/118us356)
    - A theory of  evidence for systemic discrimination is created.
    - Supreme Court established disparateoutcome (impact) as basis for establishing racial discrimination.

- [__Chae Chan Ping v. United States__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chae_Chan_Ping_v._United_States)
    - Supreme Court held that Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, passed while Chinese man was abroad, applied and revoked his re-entry permit)

- __With law the past is _always_ in the present__
    - [Why is Chae Chan Ping relevant today?](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/ghost-haunting-immigration/551015/)

- __Plenary Power Doctrine__
    - "The plenary power doctrine protects the federal government from claims that it is violating an individual's constitutional right to equal protection when it imposes discriminatory burdens on non-US citizens." - [CUNY School of Law](https://www.law.cuny.edu/legal-writing/forum/immigration-law-essays/goyal/#:~:text=The%20plenary%20power%20doctrine%20protects,burdens%20on%20non%2DUS%20citizens.)
        - i.e. Congress has 'planery power' over who can enter and exit the U.S.

- __Demographic Complexity/An Explosion of Immigrants__
    - Asian Immigrants
        - (incomplete)
        - 370,000 "arrivals" of Chinese to Hawaii and CA from late 1940's and early 1880's.
        - 1880's to about 1910: 400,000 "arrivals" of Japnese to Hawaii and the West Coast.
        - 1900-1933: 7,000 "arrivals" of Korean, 7,000 Asian Indian, 180,000 Filipinos to Hawaii and mainland.
    - European Immigrants
        - 1850-1930: 35 million European immigrants.

- __Geoolitics and Push and Pull__
    - __Colonialism and internal instability__
        - European colnial involvement
        - American colonial involvement
        - Internal instability in the modern nation-state era
    - __Labor and Capital__
        - Racialization of Labor allegations of unfair wage and job competition increases.

- __War and internal instability in China__
    - _Anglo-Chinese War of 1856-60_
        - Piracy change against British citizen leading to war
        - Ports and missionaries
    - _Taiping Rebellion 1850-1864_
        - Christianized Chinese believing brother of Jesus led rebellion across Central and South China, impacting Guangdong in particular. Estimated 10 million deaths.

- __Inequity at home tied to colonialism pushes and pulls Filipinos out__
    - Spanish-American War of 1898; and resultant Treaty of Paris resulted in U.S. possession of Phillipines. Takaki writes that Filipino peasants found that the rich rice lands they cultivated were becoming  owned by wealthy men, turning them into sharecroppers.

- __Immigration Laws and Challenges__
    - __Labor and Capital__
        - As Chan notes, colonial administrators needed cheap physical labor for their projects, thus the migrants to such colonies were disproportionately young men.  In the U.S. mainland context this resulted in labor competition with European Americans in particular, in the immediate post-Civil War era.
    - __Legal Outcomes__
        - The Chinese Exclusion Act triggered a range of challenges by Asian Americans, Chinese in particular early on, supported by funds from co-ethnic organizations such as the Chinatown based Chinese Benevolent Association.

- __Citizenship: Assimilation vs. Segregation__
    - What does the exclusion exeprience of Asian Americans (early Chinese in particular) from citizenship say about the segregation of African Americans and vice versa?

- __A "neutral principle" in the "Rule of Law" and the assertion of Fourteenth Amendment protections for _Carolene Products_ 'discrete and insular minorities'"__
    - __Neutral Principle__
        - "Rule of Law": Often stated as a broader checks and balances based principle with strong consideration of the authirity of each branch as well as the limitations on such authority. Historically asserted by the judicial branch to avoid ruling on "political" questions.
    - __Fourteenth Amendment__
        - As a tool to remedy discrimination, (specifically race early in U.S. history). _Carolene Products'_ asserted view that allegations of discrimination against "discrete and insular minorities" requires _close scrutiny_ by courts. This lead into the standard applied in _Korematsu (1944)_.

- __The American Federation of Labor's "Meat vs. Rice: American Manhood vs. Asiatic Cooliesim"__
    - Labor and Capital Conflict
        - Social Construction of __Race, Gender, and Class__
        - Close tie between rise of American unionism and trade associations with racialization through Samual Gompers-elected first president of the AFl in 1886.

- __AFK-CIO June 17, 2020 "Condemning and Combatting Anti-Asian Racism" statement__
    > "As a labor movement, we must acknowledge our own painful past on this and other racial justice issues. In 1882, then-American Federation of Labor (AFL) President Samuel Gompers pushed for the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, citing the dangers of "Asiatic" men in an essay published by the AFL and submitted as Senate testimony. Fear among White workers propelled this legislation, the first to bar an entire race from legslly entering the United States.

- __Centering Women as Active Subjects of History__
    - Hune writes that one constructive approach to situating Asian American women in history  is  to view them “as active participants in history and agents of social change, negotiating complex structures of power”
