# Week 1 (January 18 & 20): Introduction to the course. History, Memory, and Racialization

Reading: Tataki, _Strangers from a Different Shore_, Preface and Ch. 1: “From a Different Shore.”

__What is Asian American Studies?__
- Panethnicity
    - "pan" - a conglomeration
    - "ethnicity" - belonging to a social group
    - Panethnic identity example: Asian American
- Panethnicity Cultural Literacy
    - One's competency about their implicit biases

__Reading:__
- Angel Island versus Ellis Island
    - Angel Island was the west coast immigration entry point for people coming from the west (mainly Asian migration)
    - Ellis Island was the entry point for many immigrrants from the east (mainly European)
    > "Multiculuralism was a find of fear and optimism around how we are a very mixed country and what binds us together is this appreciation of different ethnic backgrounds, but we also assimilate under some cultural practice/viewpoint" - Michael Chang

__Ron Tataki on Multiculturalism (side note - "Reasonable minds may differ")__
- What is "epistemology": Theory of knowledge. Asks the question: 
    > "How do you know what you know?"

__Race is socially constructed__
- Through history socio-econmic, labor, and capital conflicts
- Any type of social norm is dependent upon contestation between people in the majority and minority. The power is _asymmetric_: Majority > Minority. 

__Cultual Literacy__
- In studying Asian American history we are learning to understand how we have come to understand American history.
    1. What are the source we have been taught?
    2. What are the viewpoints presented in the curriculum we have been taught as history?
    3. How do we believe in _cultural literacy, in that we are literate_ in a diverse range of viewpoints representing the true multicultural background of the United States?

__Arthur Schlesinger's _The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Country___
- A very different view of multiculturalism:
    - The concern of a "breaking apart" or 'Balkanization' due to conflicts
    - Association with multiculturalism with ethnic conflict
    - Reassertion of national unity around assimilation paradigm
    - The concern of the "race problem."
    - The "American Creed"
    - Schlesinger on "disuniting"

_Two different viewpoints: Ron Tataki and Arthur Schlesinger_

__Discussion Questions:__
- Takaki’s formulation of multiculturalism aligns with the concept of 
diversity, equity and inclusion of the 2000’s.  
    1. How is Diversity related to multiculturalism?
    2. What does the term "American Exceptionalism" mean to you?
        - _Schlesinger was a proponent of “American Exceptionalism” the idea that America has provided safe harbor to many different groups of people. And that here in America, class, and lineage are not important._
    3. How do Asian Americans fit into these models of diversity, multiculturalism and "American Exceptionalism"

__Asian Americans fastest-growing electorate__
- A naturalized citizen = someone who immigrated to the U.S. and gained citizenship
> “More than 11 million will be able to vote this year, making up nearly 5% of the nation’s eligible voters (for this analysis, U.S. citizens ages 18 and older). They are also the only major racial or ethnic group in which naturalized citizens – rather than the U.S. born – make up a majority of eligible voters, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data.”
- Many Asian Americans have limited English proficiency

__Aliens Ineligible for Citizenship and the 14th Amendment__
- 1790 Immigrration and Nationality Act (INA): Asian Americans were __restricted from naturalized citizenship__ from 1790 into the 1940s and until the 1950's depending on Asian ethnic groups.
- At the same time the __14th Amendment__ was passed in 1867 as an important legal tool against discrimination by state and local governments.
    - Included an important clause stating that states cannot treat people differently on the basis of race (now it includes gender)
        > "Simply stated, all persons must be treated equally without regard to their race, color, or national origin."
- Legislation in 1965: Effectively ended the immigration restrictions and quotas against many Asian immigrants

__As you move through the readings...__
- Consider what "power", "agency" and "contestation" mean in the context of the history that you reading.
- Those who are constructed in history as "minority" also have agency while those with majority power must contend with the contestationo of majority control. 
- How did the process occur in the U.S.? What are the legal and socio-cultural institutions and practices that result in a given standard of a moment in time, and in change?

__Racial Formation__
- Michael Omi & Howard Winant, Introduction, _Racial Formation in the United States_. 2014. HO
    - Dynamic-constantly in flux
    - Reproduction of political interests
        - Aligns with the notion that within a diverse society, there will be multiple stakeholders (different groups and persons bringing forth different interests). The social construction around access to property and citizenship.
    - Race is socially constructed: came out from social contestation, geopolitics, etc.
- Racial formation theory explains the fluidity of racial categories and the interest and forces that shape them. These pieces provide historical examples of how “white” identity came to be legally constructed through court cases and through the socio-economic forces supporting these legal outcomes. 
    - Do the courts drive the outcome? Legal institions?
    - 1690: the brewing slave trade
    - 1790: contestation around what “white” meant. Before the slave trade was active, the primary source of labor was young Irish women. Came as indentured servants (a form of labor in which a person is contracted to work without salary for a specific number of years). Example of instability around what being “white” meant. 
- Sociologists Omi and Winant describe the fluidity of racial constructions over time dependent on political interests and socio-economic (incomplete)
- What is Omi and Winant's concept of "common sense"?
    - “Common sense” derives from Italian philosopher and political economist Antonio Gramsci’s theories on asymmetry in political power and the interest conflicts that may emerge as a result. 
        - I.e. today’s “Common sense” surrounding gender is that gender is a social construct as opposed to one’s sex. 
        - Gramsci wrote about hegemony as in “how does power operate when there is one party that maintains much of the mechanisms of culture and state?” 
            - You have agency. A consensus that results from an agreement (not so much voluntary, but through negotiation)
