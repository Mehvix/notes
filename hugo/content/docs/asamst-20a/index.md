# Week 1 (January 18 & 20): Introduction to the course. History, Memory, and Racialization

Reading: Tataki, _Strangers from a Different Shore_, Preface and Ch. 1: “From a Different Shore.”

__What is Asian American Studies?__
- Panethnicity
    - "pan" - a conglomeration
    - "ethnicity" - belonging to a social group
    - Panethnic identity example: Asian American
- Panethnicity Cultural Literacy
    - One's competency about their implicit biases

__Reading:__
- Angel Island versus Ellis Island
    - Angel Island was the west coast immigration entry point for people coming from the west (mainly Asian migration)
    - Ellis Island was the entry point for many immigrrants from the east (mainly European)
    > "Multiculuralism was a find of fear and optimism around how we are a very mixed country and what binds us together is this appreciation of different ethnic backgrounds, but we also assimilate under some cultural practice/viewpoint" - Michael Chang

__Ron Tataki on Multiculturalism (side note - "Reasonable minds may differ")__
- What is "epistemology": Theory of knowledge. Asks the question: 
    > "How do you know what you know?"

__Race is socially constructed__
- Through history socio-econmic, labor, and capital conflicts
- Any type of social norm is dependent upon contestation between people in the majority and minority. The power is _asymmetric_: Majority > Minority. 

__Cultual Literacy__
- In studying Asian American history we are learning to understand how we have come to understand American history.
    1. What are the source we have been taught?
    2. What are the viewpoints presented in the curriculum we have been taught as history?
    3. How do we believe in _cultural literacy, in that we are literate_ in a diverse range of viewpoints representing the true multicultural background of the United States?

__Arthur Schlesinger's _The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Country___
- A very different view of multiculturalism:
    - The concern of a "breaking apart" or 'Balkanization' due to conflicts
    - Association with multiculturalism with ethnic conflict
    - Reassertion of national unity around assimilation paradigm
    - The concern of the "race problem."
    - The "American Creed"
    - Schlesinger on "disuniting"

_Two different viewpoints: Ron Tataki and Arthur Schlesinger_

__Discussion Questions:__
- Takaki’s formulation of multiculturalism aligns with the concept of 
diversity, equity and inclusion of the 2000’s.  
    1. How is Diversity related to multiculturalism?
    2. What does the term "American Exceptionalism" mean to you?
        - _Schlesinger was a proponent of “American Exceptionalism” the idea that America has provided safe harbor to many different groups of people. And that here in America, class, and lineage are not important._
    3. How do Asian Americans fit into these models of diversity, multiculturalism and "American Exceptionalism"

__Asian Americans fastest-growing electorate__
- A naturalized citizen = someone who immigrated to the U.S. and gained citizenship
> “More than 11 million will be able to vote this year, making up nearly 5% of the nation’s eligible voters (for this analysis, U.S. citizens ages 18 and older). They are also the only major racial or ethnic group in which naturalized citizens – rather than the U.S. born – make up a majority of eligible voters, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data.”
- Many Asian Americans have limited English proficiency
    - _image_

__Aliens Ineligible for Citizenship and the 14th Amendment__
- 1790 Immigrration and Nationality Act (INA): Asian Americans were __restricted from naturalized citizenship__ from 1790 into the 1940s and until the 1950's depending on Asian ethnic groups.
- At the same time the __14th Amendment__ was passed in 1867 as an important legal tool against discrimination by state and local governments.
    - Included an important clause stating that states cannot treat people differently on the basis of race (now it includes gender)
        > "Simply stated, all persons must be treated equally without regard to their race, color, or national origin."
- Legislation in 1965: Effectively ended the immigration restrictions and quotas against many Asian immigrants

__As you move through the readings...__
- Consider what "power", "agency" and "contestation" mean in the context of the history that you reading.
- Those who are constructed in history as "minority" also have agency while those with majority power must contend with the contestationo of majority control. 
- How did the process occur in the U.S.? What are the legal and socio-cultural institutions and practices that result in a given standard of a moment in time, and in change?

__Racial Formation__
- Michael Omi & Howard Winant, Introduction, _Racial Formation in the United States_. 2014. HO
    - Dynamic-constantly in flux
    - Reproduction of political interests
        - Aligns with the notion that within a diverse society, there will be multiple stakeholders (different groups and persons bringing forth different interests). The social construction around access to property and citizenship.
    - Race is socially constructed: came out from social contestation, geopolitics, etc.
- Racial formation theory explains the fluidity of racial categories and the interest and forces that shape them. These pieces provide historical examples of how “white” identity came to be legally constructed through court cases and through the socio-economic forces supporting these legal outcomes. 
    - Do the courts drive the outcome? Legal institions?
    - 1690: the brewing slave trade
    - 1790: contestation around what “white” meant. Before the slave trade was active, the primary source of labor was young Irish women. Came as indentured servants (a form of labor in which a person is contracted to work without salary for a specific number of years). Example of instability around what being “white” meant. 
- Sociologists Omi and Winant describe the fluidity of racial constructions over time dependent on political interests and socio-economic (incomplete)
- What is Omi and Winant's concept of "common sense"?
    - “Common sense” derives from Italian philosopher and political economist Antonio Gramsci’s theories on asymmetry in political power and the interest conflicts that may emerge as a result. 
        - I.e. today’s “Common sense” surrounding gender is that gender is a social construct as opposed to one’s sex. 
        - Gramsci wrote about hegemony as in “how does power operate when there is one party that maintains much of the mechanisms of culture and state?” 
            - You have agency. A consensus that results from an agreement (not so much voluntary, but through negotiation)

__What is a "Race" versus an "Ethnicity"?__
_Consider the challenge of formally categorizing groups:_
- The U.S. Census Bureau uses the term "Hispanis"
    - Who are "Hispanics"?
    - Who ae "Latinos"?
    - (incomplete)

__Taki referred to the popular perception of Asian Americans as:__
1. __Model Minority:__ A trope that gained traction in the 1960s that stresses the prototypical Asian’s high achievement in socioeconomic status and focuses on their culture to explain their “success”; denies racism and other hardships that are experienced by Asian Americans; comparison between one minority group and another 
2. __Perpetual Foreigner:__ stereotype in which naturalized and even native-born citizens are perceived by some members of the majority as foreign because they belong to a minority ethnic or racial group.

_Twin pillars of how Asian Americans are constructed_
> How do these sterotypes and categories affect cultural and legal outcomes for Asian Americans?

__The Social Construction of Race__
- The idea that race is socially constructed emerged as a response to the view that race is based on biology
    - What does it mean to say that race is _not_ based on biology? Does it mean that there are no biological or genetic bases to difference?
    - What is the difference between _(incomplete)_ and _race_?
    - Blood quantum: the idea that if you have any drop of African American ancestry, in that jurisdiction/state, you are legally classified as black
        - For whites to maintain racial purity, property, power, and __perpetuated the classification/segregation of people on the basis of race__

__Class Question: How has federal jurisdiction driven civil rights protections from the time of early Asian immigrants to the U.S. to the 2020s?__

- For example, the Interstate Commerce Act addressed the problem of railroad monopolies by setting guidelines for how the railroads could do business.

__Insiders and Outsiders__
1. As cited in footnote 4 of the U.S. Supreme Court's _Carolene Products the Tainted Milk_, case:
> “prejudice directed against discrete and insular minorities may call for “more searching judicial inquiry.”
- Ensured that former slave-holding states would abide by this 14th amendment that said that African Americans had to have citizenship rights
- Created a legal authority when the former slave-holding states tried to reinstitute some form of slavery 
2. _Racial formation_ construction? (incomplete)

__Sojourners vs. Immigrants__
- Labor and capital interests drove demand for cheap labor during U.S. industrialization

__Push and Pull__
- Geopolitical
- political economic factors

__Alienation of Migration Guangdong Chinese Women sang__
> _Dear husband, ever since you sojourned.  
> In a foreign land.  
> I've lost interest in all matters.  
> All day long, I stay inside the bedroom,  
> My brows knitted; ten thousand  
> Thoughts bring me endless remorse, in  
> Grief, in silence.  
> I cannot fall asleep on my lonely pillow._

__1882 Chinese Exclusion Act__
- Racialized labor conflict and competition
- The main landmark that stems from aliens ineligible for citizenship

__Agency, Resistance and Contestation__
- Yick Wo v. Hopkins, USC 1996
    - Provides the basis for the important legal evidence standard of "disparate impact"
    - Supreme Court said that San Francisco zoning law is in violation of the 14th Amendment

__120,000 Americans of Japanese descent on the Western U.S. seaboard were sent to internment camps. 75% of internees were American citizens by birth.__

# Week 2 (January 25 & 27): The racialization of Asian Americans: contemporary images and historical transformations.

Reading: Okihiro, _Common Ground_, Preface & Ch. 2: “White and Black.”

__Class Question:__ Okihiro writes in his preface that his book _Common Ground_ is about the "creation of the American character and subject."

What does he mean by that?
- the social construction of the nation

__Binaries as convenient cognitive and socio-political constructs__

- Binaries offer coherence, especially during times of social upheaval. They preserve rule amidst apparaent chaos, and stability amidst rapid change, such as during the late eighteenth, nineteenth, and twntieth centuries (i.e industrial revolution, enlightenment, romanticism). Those periods of American history occasioned social reconstitutions of geographies, race, gender, sexuality and nationality that helped to define and regulate identities, the state, and the social formation.

__Break out question:__ What are some modern-day binaries and what socio-political institutions or relationships and hierarchies do they support?
- gender norms, environmental conservation, wealth inequality

__What are some binary ideas or myths based on the social construction of an East vs. West divide?__
- Rudyard Kipling _The Ballad of East and West_, 1889
    > Oh,  East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,
    > Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;
    > But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,
    > When two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends of the earth!
    - These poems pervade our perceptions and are descriptors for historical moments in time. They are important signifiers of binaries

__Model Minority vs. Perpetual Foreigner__
- Are these two poles of the social construction of Asian Americans binary?
- How do they serve to construct the "Asian American subject?"

__Korematsu v. United States__
> "In response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, the U.S. government decided to require Japanese-Americans to move into relocation camps as a matter of national security. President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, two months after Pearl Harbor. A Japanese-American man living in San Leandro, Fred Korematsu, chose to stay at his residence rather than obey the order to relocate. Korematsu was arrested and convicted of violating the order. He responded by arguing that Executive Order 9066 violated the Fifth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit affirmed Korematsu's conviction." - Oyez
- __Conclusion:__ The Court ruled against Korematsu. The Court believed that the decision was valid because it was a necessity amid the danger of espionage and sabotage. 

__Common ground vs. Mrgins as the Mainstream__
- Okihiro writes that his book seeks to reject binaries and to advocate for a "open, borderless" common ground" versus his prior argument that the mainstream norms, rights, values of America were created by the margins.
    - meaning that the _margins create the mainstream._
