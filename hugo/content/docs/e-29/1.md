## Evolution of graphical visualization

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Hand drawing
- Instrument drawing (using mechanical things to measure distances)
- 2D CAD (initially only able to draw side views)
- 3D CAD (solid modeling)
	- Automatic generation of 2D working drawings
	- Enable easy communication of measurements between designer and manufacturer
	- Created with the assumption that manufactured objects are made up of elementary objects, [geons?](../cogsci-c100/perception.md#recognition-by-components-model)
	- Now we have the ability to run algos to analyze models, removing unnecessary bits
    - We're moving towards computer-generated geometry that's contained by human input

{{< /columns >}}
- Increasingly complex geometries
	- [Topological optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization)
	- Internal lattices
	- The way we interface with drawings has to keep up with this
- New interfaces
	- Virtual and augmented reality for visualizing designs

### Why bother sketching by hand?
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
![](/docs/e-29/1/evo1.png)
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
- Why not go straight to CAD?
- Some possible reasons:
	- There is a connection between drawing and your own creativity; a feedback loop of sorts
	- CAD bottlenecks you to designing a certain way
	- Find one’s own distinctive style
	- Avoid making detailed decisions too early
	- Keep geometries more freeform
	- Ideas may come to mind anywhere, anytime
	- Potentially quicker

### Essentials of 2D sketching

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Line types matters
	- **Solid:** edges
	- **Dashed:** hidden detail
	- **Chain:** centerline. 
    	- `- . - . ` ...
	- **Faint:** construction
    	- Align, but don't touch, features
	- **Dimension lines:** 
    	- Fainter than edges, and not connected. 
    	- Long, thin arrows.
    	- Lots of differing standards, just be consistent

## 3D pictorial approaches

### Isometric drawing


{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- 'iso' = same, 'metric' = measure
    - Any lines parallel .$x,y,z$ on the lines are equal length
- Orthogonal edges of a 3D object map to:
	- Vertical lines
	- Lines at .$\pm 30^\circ$ to horizontal
- Dimensions in these orthogonal directions are preserved on page
- Dimensions in other directions are not preserved on page 
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->

{{< /columns >}}

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Circles in isometric
    - Use construction lines for bounding box
    - Mark midpoints
    - Draw longer quadrants first
    - Through holes: use construction lines for obscured circle; darken later
    - What if circle is not on an orthogonal face?

### Coded plans for practicing isometric sketching
- Principle: number in cell gives height of column to be drawn
- Codes could be given on isometric or square grid ([plan view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_(drawing)))
- Square grid: viewpoint explicitly specified

{{< /columns >}}
- Different views / perspectives may obscure different features. Chose the one that minimizes information loss / ambiguity
- You can shade certain surface to convey shadow (and thus depth, 3D information)

### Axonometric drawing
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Orthogonal edges are represented by:
	- Vertical lines
	- Lines at .$\pm 45^\circ$ to horizontal
- Advantage:
	- Floorplans are not skewed/distorted
- Disadvantage:
	- Areas of equal orthogonal faces are not equal on drawing
	- Can look more "distorted"

### Oblique drawings

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Front view is undistorted
- Conveys lots of information of a single face
- Angles are arbitrary (here they're ~45)
- Receding lines drawn at a constant angle
- Judgement needed to select scale for receding direction
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->

{{< /columns >}}


### Perspective drawing
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Simulates how the eye sees 3D objects: further away objects/details are smaller
- Much more challenging than other methods
	- Receding lines not parallel
	- But CAD software can generate
- Horizon line
- Vanishing point(s)
	- One point: dimensions referenced from closest surface
	- Two points: dimensions referenced from closest edge

## Introduction to sketching tools

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
### Digital sketching tools

- Autodesk Sketchbook
	- Import isometric grid on Layer 2
	- Draw on Layer 1
- Google Jamboard
- OneNote
- Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator
- Software resource page in bCourses
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
### Analog sketching tools

- Set square/drawing triangle
- Pencils:
	- Various hardness/softness
	- Mechanical vs traditional
- Pens
	- Ballpoint
	- Felt tip
	- Technical

### Possible ways of enhancing 3D sketches

- Shading
	- Simulate the effect of light falling on object
- Visual clarity
	- Edges bolder: example of how it clears confusion
- Suggesting motion, sound, texture…
