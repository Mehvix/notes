# Tuesday 1/18 -- Course introduction

## Overview

<!-- **These are notes are also on [notes.mehvix.com/e-29/](https://notes.mehvix.com/e-29/)** -->
<!-- DSP note^ -->

This class focuses on three main components -- manufacturing processes, dimensional tolerances, and design communication -- and how they interact with one another.

The class is made up of 9 modules:
1. Fundamentals
2. Subtractive manufacturing processes
3. Additive manufacturing processes
4. Forming processes
5. Joining processes
6. Graphical visualization techniques
7. Metrology: measuring manufactured objects
8. Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing
9. The future of manufacturing

## Why manufacturing?

- In 2018, U.S. manufacturing accounted for 11.6% of the U.S. economy, 18.2% of global manufacturing output, and 8.2% of the U.S. workforce -- [source](https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-manufacturing-what-it-is-statistics-and-outlook-3305575)
- Manufacturing output is growing, and is returning to the U.S.; output increased >30% between end of 2008 and 2014
- 67% of U.S. R&D is funded by industry
- Even when production is offshore, design is often done here anyway
- Automation is increasing, yet there is a shortage of skilled (human) talent
- Even if you don't want to go into manufacturing industry, research and academia still require manufacturing knowledge 
- Even if the process if outsourced, design is still done in the US. To design well, you have to have a base-level understanding of manufacturing

## Processes

In this class we will consider multiple families of processes:
![Processes](/docs/e-29/1/processes.png)
- This is a rapidly moving field that is always adapting
- This class should give you a top level overview so you can evaluate novel methods


## Materials
In this class we will consider multiple families of materials:
![Materials](/docs/e-29/1/materials.png)
- Materials choices influence performance
  - For example, consider the progress of the plane:
  - In 1903 the right brothers low-density wood with steel wire and silk
  - In 1935 the Douglas DC3 used aluminum alloy (since it became feasible to produce and manipulate)
  - Now the 2010 [Boeing 787 Dreamliner](http://www.boeing.com/commercial/787family/programfacts.html) is made up of 50 wt% composites 20 wt% aluminum 15 wt% titanium 20% lower fuel consumption per passenger mile
      - Composite materials are two(+) materials combined together to get best of both worlds, in aviation typically stiff/strong carbon fibers embed in tough/fatigue-resistant polymers.
- Materials choices influence market size
![Cams](/docs/e-29/1/cams.png)
  - There isn't always a best material; different materials fit different markets/needs
  - Opposite side of the coin: There may be multiple valid material choices for a particular function

## Tolerance

- Tolerancing is a formal way of specifying limits on the amount of dimensional variability allowable in manufactured parts
  - We need a range because measurements will never be 100% precise; we need to define an acceptable range
  - Some sources of variation
      - Human operator changes and/or errors
      - Tool wear
      - Environmental changes (temperature, humidity leads to tiny expansions / contractions)
      - Input material variability
      - Measurement error
- Affordable mass-production _relies on interchangeability of parts_
    - When mating parts of given designs, it should not matter which specific parts
- Therefore part dimensions must be consistent
    - But no manufacturing process is perfectly consistent
- If you don't understand the process of manufacturing and the capabilities of tools, then you will won't know how to create manufacturable designs

- Tighter tolerances (closer tolerance limits) are generally more expensive to achieve
- The solid green line shows an ideal process
- The dotted green line shows the impact of an error shifting the distribution, shifting the tails to approach the tolerance upper / lower bound
- The red line shows a unsuitable process (even if it's calibrated accurately, the poor precision causes high variance that it's not really feasible; however, if outside of the limits an additive (or less common subtractive) could be used to )

### How E29 integrates manufacturing and tolerancing

- Tighter tolerances are more expensive
- The physics of a process determine how tight a tolerance is achievable and how much it costs
- Therefore we need to understand how manufacturing processes work in order to:
    - Select a suitable process for the application
    - Specify reasonable tolerances
    - Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing: a graphical language for specifying tolerances robustly

## Design Communication

- Important to effectively describe your ideas and designs graphically
    - Persuade -- we need to be able to show are perspective
    - Instruct -- we need an agreed an unambiguous way to communicate
    - Document -- we need to convey how to construct our final design 
    - Seek feedback -- we need to ensure everyone is on the same page
- Drawings can be 2D or 3D representations
    - Interpreting 2D drawings made by others
    - Creating 2D “working drawings” with unambiguous instructions
- Design communication is not only graphical
    - Oral, written
    - Manufacturing relies on teams
    - Teaming activities
