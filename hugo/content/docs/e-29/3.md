# 02-08: Additive processes: overview, and extrusion-based processes 

## Reasons to use additive manufacturing

- Geometry needs customization
    - Medical implants and prostheses; dental aligners, crowns, bridges, surgical guides, footwear 
- Run size too small for custom tooling
    - e.x. [Aircraft cabin components](https://www.tctmagazine.com/3d-printing-news/british-airways-top-ten-applications-3d-printing/) (e.g. ducting, seats); titanium alloy turbine blades; mounting brackets; [engine fuel nozzles](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-11-27/general-electric-turns-to-3d-printers-for-plane-parts)
- Supply chain is challenging in some way (geographically or temporally)
    - Enables more decentralized/distributed production
    - e.x. [Space Station](https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/4-products-that-make-sense-to-manufacture-in-orbit); food preparation
- No other manufacturing processes exist that can deliver the required geometry or properties
    - Multimaterial
    - Graded stiffness or color
    - Internal porosity for reduced mass
- Need fast feedback on a geometry (rapid prototyping) 
    - e.g. Architectural models, Microsoft Surface
- Less workers (human controllers) required -- cheaper, less error
- Why Not:
    - Potentially waste more material 
    - Supports are annoying to remove

### Working principles for additive manufacturing

- This is a very rapidly developing field
- Material supply:
    - Gas (semiconductor manufacturing)
    - Solution (Electroplating)
    - Laminae (sheets of material), i.e [Fabrisonic](https://fabrisonic.com/technology/)
- Conversion:
    - Laser (temporarily) melting
- Energy:
    - Heat
    - Cooling (cryo-printing, biological tissue)
    - Plasma
- Spatial:
    - moving tool versus moving work
    - belt/string drive
    - screen projector
    - [scanning mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_scanning#Scanning_mirrors) (galvanometer scanner)
> Some of these seem unrealistic, and they may be, right now. But technology is rapidly increasing and what is unfeasible today may be feasible very soon. Think neural networks-- we've known the underlying concepts since [1873](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network#History) but only now has technology become fast enough for it to become feasible

## Details and capabilities of additive processes


### Simple model for extrusion

{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/3/base.png" >}}
- Material must able to heat up and cool down while maintaining it's key properties
- Higher the temperature, more energy required, lower the viscosity

### Considerations

## Methods for polymers

### Fused deposition modeling (FDM)

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Need models for heat transfer at printing location
- Also called Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)
- Print time depends strongly on:
    - Machine,
    - Component size/geometry,
    - In-fill strategy

#### Stress Line Additive Manufacturing (SLAM) 

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Fused deposition modeling (FDM) [sometimes known as fused filament fabrication (FFF)] is usually carried out layer-by-layer but inter-layer voids or defects can reduce strength or make strength highly directional.
- If the filament orientation can be optimized based on knowledge of the way the part will be loaded (i.e. aligning filaments with the principal stress lines), strength could be improved.
- This is what SLAM aims to achieve.
- Extrusion nozzle path planning is more challenging than in layer-by-layer FDM.

### Direct ink writing

- Lead zirconium titanate ceramic particles in a solvent dispensed via nozzle
- Piezoelectric material
- Sintered to fuse particles and drive off binder
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
![](/docs/e-29/3/ink2.png)
- Material flow is achieved by using a thixotropic (shear- thinning) ink rather than thermally softening polymer (like squeezing toothpaste from a tube)
- Features down to ~ 1 micrometer possible by extrusion through fine needles
- Advantages: heat not required; more material possibilities
![](/docs/e-29/3/istress.png)
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
![](/docs/e-29/3/ink1.png)
- Shear stress in material, ùúèùúè, is defined by: .$\tau = \tau_y + K \dot \gamma ^n$
- .$\tau_y$ is zero-shear-rate yield stress (Pa)
- .$K$ is a material constant
- .$\hat \gamma$ is shear rate (1/s)
- .$n$ is shear-thinning exponent (<1 for this process to work)

{{< /columns >}}


### Stereolithography

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- A bath/‚Äúvat‚Äù or tray of photo- curable liquid is locally crosslinked (solidified) with a scanning laser beam or projected light pattern, usually violet (~405 nm) or ultraviolet (~365 nm)
- Absorption of photons as they pass through the liquid limits crosslinking to a small layer (typically tens of Œºm thick) at a time
- Two machine design approaches:
    - Light shines down onto liquid surface; platform moves down into the vat as the part builds up
    - Light shines up through a window; part gradually drawn up out of a tray of resin
- Stereolithography using a light projector
- Machines from Carbon, Formlabs, 3D Systems‚Ä¶
- Inverted setup:
    - Printed object drawn upwards out of tray of resin
    - Separation from tray: peeling or O2-inhibited dead layer

#### Resin solidification in stereolithography
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/3/solid.png" >}}

- Absorption of the illuminating light means that exposure dose .$E(z)$ decreases exponentially with depth below resin surface .$z$:
    $$E(z) = E_0 e^{-z/D_p}$$
    - .$D_p$ is the penetration depth, a resin property
    - Dose is the time integral of power intensity
    - In projector-based systems, .$E_0 = I_0 t_\text{layer}$
    - In laser-scanning systems, .$E_0$ is a function of illumination power intensity (W/m.$^2$), beam diameter w (m), and scanning speed, v (m/s):

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Gelation just occurs at the curing depth, .$D_c$ where the resin receives the curing dose, .$E_c$:
    $$E_c = E_0 e^{-D_c/D_p} \Longrightarrow D_c = D_p \ln \bigg( \frac{E_0}{E_c} \bigg)$$
- Cured material may not be very strong at curing depth, so layers typically overlap in z direction to ensure material is all well-gelled

- Elastic modulus and color can be varied spatially by mixing inks
- A wide range of mechanical properties (including elastomers) are now possible
- Note that these are ‚Äúsimulated‚Äù materials: the printed inks are photocured whereas the final production material may be, e.g., thermoplastic
- Electrically conductive materials are beginning to emerge

### Powder/binder methods



### Selective laser melting/sintering (SLS)


{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->

- Processes powders layer by layer
- Can be applied to thermoplastic polymers (esp. Nylon), metals, and even ceramics
- Powder particles are heated enough that surfaces mel.t Atoms/molecules at their surfaces interdiffuse, bonding the particles.
- Parts usually retain some porosity 
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/3/slm2.png" >}}
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/3/slm.png" >}}
- Scanning laser beam completely melts the powder during processing
- Greater control of grain structure and lower porosity than with selective laser sintering
- Fully dense structures achievable
- Sometimes called Direct Metal Laser Melting or Directed Energy Deposition
{{< /columns >}}

#### Examples of components

- 3D printed gas turbine blades
    - Polycrystalline nickel superalloy
    - Layer by layer powder fusion
    - Survived 13,000 rpm at 1250 ¬∞C
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/3/slmex.png" >}}
- Application: pressure sensor housing in General Electric jet engine compressor
    - Co-Cr alloy
    - 19 of them in the GE LEAP engine
    - Replaces a casting process
    - Development time up to a year faster than using casting
    - Made using SLM
- Example of remanufacturing with SLM 
![](/docs/e-29/3/reman.png)


### Electron-beam melting

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Like SLM, produces fully dense parts
- Operates in vacuum
    - In contrast, SLM uses an inert gas atmosphere
    - Vacuum allows higher temperatures to be used (> 800 K)
    - Reduces oxidation and porosity due to adsorbed gases
- Materials more limited than SLM
    - Examples: Ti grade 2, Ti6Al4V, Inconel 718, CoCrMo

### Tuning material properties with structure

- Printed cellular structures can offer new classes of material
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/3/turning.png" >}}

### Current challenges with 3D printing

- Speed ‚Äì for a single material and non-freeform geometry, machining is still probably quicker; injection molding is certainly faster
- Lower mechanical strength ‚Äì directionality, porosity, surface flaws
- Surface finish ‚Äì roughness often of many microns
- Resolution ‚Äì from ~ 0.25 mm for basic FDM down to a few microns for SLA/SLS/SLM. Sub-micrometer resolution possible for two-photon SLA.
- Expense of input material ‚Äì fine filaments, powders, inks: some proprietary consumables

## Potential future applications of 3D printing

- Food?
- Clothes?
- Human organs?
- Houses?
- What are the challenges of 3D printing?
    - Intellectual property; forgery
    - Difficulty of regulating production (e.g. of weapons; organs)
    - Carbon footprint (energy input) of 3D-printed components vs traditionally manufactured components
    - Overall will 3D printing create or destroy jobs?
