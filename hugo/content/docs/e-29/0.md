# 01-18: Course introduction

## Overview

This class focuses on three main components -- manufacturing processes, dimensional tolerances, and design communication -- and how they interact with one another.

{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/0/about.png" >}}

The class is made up of 9 modules:
1. Fundamentals
2. Subtractive manufacturing processes
3. Additive manufacturing processes
4. Forming processes
5. Joining processes
6. Graphical visualization techniques
7. Metrology: measuring manufactured objects
8. Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing
9. The future of manufacturing

## Why manufacturing?

- In 2018, U.S. manufacturing accounted for 11.6% of the U.S. economy, 18.2% of global manufacturing output, and 8.2% of the U.S. workforce -- [source](https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-manufacturing-what-it-is-statistics-and-outlook-3305575)
- Manufacturing output is growing, and is returning to the U.S.; output increased >30% between end of 2008 and 2014
- 67% of U.S. R&D is funded by industry
- Even when production is offshore, design is often done here anyway
- Automation is increasing, yet there is a shortage of skilled (human) talent
- Even if you don't want to go into manufacturing industry, research and academia still require manufacturing knowledge
- Even if the process if outsourced, design is still done in the US. To design well, you have to have a base-level understanding of manufacturing

## Processes

In this class we will consider multiple families of processes:
![Processes](/docs/e-29/0/processes.png)
- This is a rapidly moving field that is always adapting
- This class should give you a top level overview so you can evaluate novel methods


## Materials
In this class we will consider multiple families of materials:
![Materials](/docs/e-29/0/materials.png)
- Materials choices influence performance
  - For example, consider the progress of the plane:
  - In 1903 the right brothers low-density wood with steel wire and silk
  - In 1935 the Douglas DC3 used aluminum alloy (since it became feasible to produce and manipulate)
  - Now the 2010 [Boeing 787 Dreamliner](http://www.boeing.com/commercial/787family/programfacts.html) is made up of 50 wt% composites 20 wt% aluminum 15 wt% titanium 20% lower fuel consumption per passenger mile
      - Composite materials are two(+) materials combined together to get best of both worlds, in aviation typically stiff/strong carbon fibers embed in tough/fatigue-resistant polymers.
- Materials choices influence market size
![Cams](/docs/e-29/0/cams.png)
  - There isn't always a best material; different materials fit different markets/needs
  - Opposite side of the coin: There may be multiple valid material choices for a particular function

## Tolerance

- Tolerancing is a formal way of specifying limits on the amount of dimensional variability allowable in manufactured parts
  - We need a range because measurements will never be 100% precise; we need to define an acceptable range
  - Some sources of variation
      - Human operator changes and/or errors
      - Tool wear
      - Environmental changes (temperature, humidity leads to tiny expansions / contractions)
      - Input material variability
      - Measurement error
- Affordable mass-production _relies on interchangeability of parts_
    - When mating parts of given designs, it should not matter which specific parts
- Therefore part dimensions must be consistent
    - But no manufacturing process is perfectly consistent
- If you don't understand the process of manufacturing and the capabilities of tools, then you will won't know how to create manufacturable designs

{{< hint "info" >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/0/graph.png" >}}
- Tighter tolerances (closer tolerance limits) are generally more expensive to achieve
- The solid green line shows an ideal process
- The dotted green line shows the impact of an error shifting the distribution, shifting the tails to approach the tolerance upper / lower bound
- The red line shows a unsuitable process (even if it's calibrated accurately, the poor precision causes high variance that it's not really feasible; however, if outside of the limits an additive (or less common subtractive) could be used to )
{{< /hint >}}


### How E29 integrates manufacturing and tolerancing

- Tighter tolerances are more expensive
- The physics of a process determine how tight a tolerance is achievable and how much it costs
- Therefore we need to understand how manufacturing processes work in order to:
    - Select a suitable process for the application
    - Specify reasonable tolerances
    - Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing: a graphical language for specifying tolerances robustly

## Design Communication

- Important to effectively describe your ideas and designs graphically
    - Persuade -- we need to be able to show are perspective
    - Instruct -- we need an agreed an unambiguous way to communicate
    - Document -- we need to convey how to construct our final design
    - Seek feedback -- we need to ensure everyone is on the same page
- Drawings can be 2D or 3D representations
    - Interpreting 2D drawings made by others
    - Creating 2D “working drawings” with unambiguous instructions
- Design communication is not only graphical
    - Oral, written
    - Manufacturing relies on teams
    - Teaming activities


# 01-20: Fundamentals of Tolerancing

- See [why we study tolerancing](1.md#tolerance) from yesterday's notes

## Basic tolerance formats

1. Unilateral
   - e.g. Inches: .$.500^{+0.005}_{-0.000}$, Metric: .$35^{+0.05}_0$ (notice [sigfig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures) notation)
2. Bilateral
   - Most common; start with nominal then you have some tolerance bounds above and below
   - Equal or unequal deviations from nominal dimension
   - Same number of decimal places for upper and lower limits
   - e.g. Inches: .$.500 \pm .005$ or .$.500^{+0.005}_{-.010}$, Metric: .$35 \pm 0.05$ or .$35^{+0.05} _{-0.10}$
3. Limit
   - Given only bounds, not the nominal value
   - e.g. Inches: .$.250, .248$, Metric: .$35.05, 35.00$

## Tolerance buildup

- In the real world we have error, so the way we define dimensions have an impact
- Best dimensions to label depend on function
    - That is, dimensioning should be done intentionally such that _critical_ distances result in minimal error,
    - e.g.suppose distance between .$X$ and .$Y$ is critical

{{< hint "info" >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
![Side Projection](/docs/e-29/0/buildup.png)
- Chain is bad since the potential (and often times real world) maximum error is large
    - The errors compound since dimensions are in reference to other dimensions that ~~may~~ will contain error.
    - The more dimensions chained, the greater the possible error
- Baseline is better -- every feature references a single base.
    - However the worst case is still significant
    - .$X$ may be off by .$\pm .05$ and .$Y$ may be off .$\mp 05$, compounding to .$\pm 0.10$!
- Direct is ideal
    - Depends on which dimensions are critical (that is, .$X, Y$)

## Normal cumulative distribution function

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Tighter tolerances (closer tolerance limits) are generally more expensive to achieve
- The physics of **the process used determines the curve's characteristics**
    - .$\sigma$ is the [stdiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) (width) of this density
- .$\mu = x_0$ is the target (average) value we give
- This probability density characterizes how this function is distributed and the chance a given range of values occur
    - The area under the curve in a given range is the probability the value falls within that range
    - Single values, i.e .$x_0$, have a 0% probability. We can only calculate ranges because this is a **density function**.
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
> ![Distribution](/docs/e-29/0/distribution.png)
> Probability density, e.g. given by [Gaussian/Normal probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function):
> $$p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
{{< /columns >}}

- Why do we care about statistics?
    - We want to look at a process, look at tolerances, and figure out whether it's worth to manufacture using this process
    - If you know the distribution of a process, you can work out the probability a given part satisfies spec limits.
- There is no easy, exact analytical way to integrate the normal probability density function.
    - The probability that a randomly chosen member of a normally distributed population has a value .$\leq x$ is
    $$\int_{-\infty}^x p(x)\ dx = P(x) = Z\bigg(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\bigg) = \frac{1}{2}\bigg[1 + \text{erf}\bigg(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}\bigg)\bigg]$$
      - .$\text{erf()}$ is the error function
      - .$Z$ is the [normal cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function); values of .$Z$ are [tabulated in a Z table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_normal_table)

{{< details "Example probability of part lying between within spec limits" >}}
![Distribution Example](/docs/e-29/0/dist-ex.png)
{{< /details >}}


## Process capability and tolerancing

- Sigma, .$\sigma$, is the standard deviation of dimensions actually produced by a process
- [Six sigma processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma)
    > Six Sigma (6σ) is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. [...] A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.
    - Specification limits are .$12\sigma$ apart. Here, 2 parts per billion lie outside specification limits if process is 'in control' (i.e. if mean output of process is centered between specification limits)
    - Arose because the cost of manufacturing, specifically the process that creates an error, has a cost. This cost can grow very large, very quickly, when mass-manufacturing.
        - You're best off spending money improving the process so the distribution gets tighter
        - The alternative is either (1) accepting errors (resulting in faulty products) or (2) testing all components to ensure they are 'good' and tossing out the bad ones
    - Process capability: .$C_p = \frac{\text{USL - LSL}}{6\sigma}$


## Classes of Fit

- Tolerances should be...
    - Not too tight: tight tolerances are expensive
    - Not too loose: otherwise function is compromised

{{< hint "info" >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
![Zones](/docs/e-29/0/zones.png)

1. **Clearance fit:** designed with space left between two components
    - e.g. a shaft with a bearing need to have some give / free space
2. **Interference (push) fit:** designed to be touching
    - You may want interference because you want the friction between the components; you want the two pieces to not move/rotate/etc
    - How? Elastic or even plastic deformation
    - e.g. two pieces may need to fit tightly with friction as to prevent vibrations
    - Expansion fit:
        - If there are large forces/torques acting on these two components so you want them **very tight**
        - e.g. you may temporarily expand one component (e.x. with heat) to fit on/around the other, then it will shrink down
    - Shrink fit:
        - Same as expansion, but using some cooling process (e.x. liquid nitrogen)
        - Why do this over heat?
            - It's typically more expensive to cool down
            - The material may deform / weaken -- e.g. steel will be degraded if heated up
3. **Transition fit:** complete interchangeability is compromised to allow looser tolerance on individual components.
    - If fit type is not critical.
    - But even then, why not choose one or the other? Because you don't want a large gap and the materials/parts cannot withstand the force needed to assemble them with an interference fit.
    - The pieces are just for alignment -- think Ikea assembly pegs; they're just to align components.
    - It's easier to manufacture these parts

### Snap fits

![Snap](/docs/e-29/0/snap.png)
- Involves temporary elastic deflection which enables parts to interlock, e.g. involving bending of one component
- Done often with molded parts
- Tends to involve Cantilever (e.g. casings), Annular (e.g. pen lids, take-out soup container lids)
- Designed to be assembled once, and typically not disassembled (multiple times) -- irreversible.
- Relatively simple: you don't need screws/glues/etc. -- useful for rapid prototyping since you don't have to consider fasteners
- Takes advantage of the fact that the material has some elasticity
    - You need to stay within the elasticity limits of the material
    - Most 3D plastics have 'enough' give
    - You (generally) want to design such that the stress is from bending, not stretching

### Terminology Definitions

> Don't stress about memorizing these !

{{< hint "info" >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
![Clearance and interference fits](/docs/e-29/0/fit-ex.png)
- **Maximum material condition _(MMC)_:** The greatest allowable amount of material left on the part (max size for a shaft; min size for a hole)
- **Minimum/least material condition _(LMC)_:** The least allowable amount of material left on the part (min size for a shaft; max size for a hole)
    - Important with MMC since they tell us how much they're able to 'slosh around'
- **Basic size:** Exact theoretical size from which limits are derived
    - Different form nominal since basic refers to the standard table which gives respective upper and lower bounds (MMC and LMCs)
    - Hole basis: Basic size is minimum size of hole
    - Shaft basis: Basic size is maximum size of shaft -- used when many components need to fit on to one shaft.
    - Basic size could be chosen to be in-between hole and shaft basis
- **Tolerance:** Allowable variation of one particular dimension
- **Fundamental deviation:** Difference between basic size and the closer of the MMC and LMC
- **Allowance:** Difference between maximum material conditions of the two components

## Types of fit

- These types are created by ANSI: American National Standards Institute
- Exact values are tabulated in many source

---
- RC: Running and sliding clearance fits
    - Nine categories:
        - RC1: Close sliding: assemble without perceptible “play” (e.g. watches)
            - Less than a 1/1000".
            - Basically impossible for air, let alone liquids, through.
        - RC2: Sliding fits: seize with small temperature changes (e.g. )
        - RC3: Precision running: not suitable for appreciable temperature differences
        - RC4: Close running: moderate surface speeds and pressures
        - RC5/6: Medium running: higher speed/pressure
        - RC7: Free running: where accuracy not essential and/or temperature variations large
        - RC8/9: Loose running
  - Go for lower if you want minimal vibration/gaps -- no perceivable play.
  - Has drawbacks:
      - The less clearance, the easier it is to seize up -- especially if two components are touching and made up of different materials (different expansion/contraction rates).
      - Susceptible to dust, you would have to seal the machine or use it in clean conditions.
  - If you go less precise, you don't need to go slow, cheaper operator costs, cheaper tooling

## Processes, tolerances, and surface quality

- How do we relate physical processes and tools to these values?

> From _MF Ashby, Materials Selection in Mechanical Design_


### Roughness

- How do we define roughness? You may use tool that uses a tiny needle to 'scan' the surface, measuring deflections as you go
> {{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/0/roughness.png" >}}
> From _MF Ashby, Materials Selection in Mechanical Design_
- **RMS roughness:** root mean square of deviations over the measured surface length
    - i.e.: .$R^2 = L^{-1} \int_0^L y^2\ dx$
    - Usually, tolerance, .$T$, lies between 5R and 1000R
- Generally, if you go high rotation speed and slow translational speed you get less rough surfaces
