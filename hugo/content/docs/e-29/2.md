## Nomenclature of cutting process


### Merchant‚Äôs circle: cutting forces
- **Force diagram** that resolves the reaction force exerted by the tool on the work
    ![](/docs/e-29/1/merch.png)
- Relating cutting geometry to cutting forces
    - Material properties link the geometry of the tool and cutting path to the forces involved.
    - The material being cut needs to exceed its shear yield stress to start deforming (cutting) and creating a chip.
    - If the material exceeds its ultimate shear strength, the chip becomes more likely to fragment into pieces as it forms (which may help clear waste material away).
    - However, the more strain involved in chip formation for a given material, the more work has to be invested in the cutting operation.
    - Therefore designing the cutting operation to limit shear strain can help to limit cutting energy required.

### How can we predict shear strain, .$\gamma$
- Since we wish to limit the amount of shear strain occurring during cutting, we need to understand how it depends on parameters that we can control.
	- Parameters we control: .$f, V_\text{cut}, d, \omega, \alpha$.
	- Parameters we don‚Äôt directly control, but can measure: .$c, F_c , F_t$
	- Parameters we don‚Äôt directly control and are hard to measure directly: .$\phi \beta$, and forces other than .$F_c$ and .$F_t$
- Next, we show (via geometry) how shear strain .$\gamma$ depends on shear angle .$\phi$ (which is hard to measure directly) and on rake angle .$\alpha$ (which is known in advance).
    - To predict .$\phi$, we then have two options: ‚Ä¢ Measure chip thickness, c, and use geometry to work out .$\phi$ in terms of f, c and .$\alpha$, or
	- Use Merchant‚Äôs shear angle relationship to express .$\phi$ in terms of .$\alpha$ and .$\beta$, and find .$\beta$ by measuring cutting and thrust forces Fc and Ft (e.g. by force sensors on the cutting tool holder)
- Then, we can take action to control shear strain and cutting force.


### Relationship between .$\phi$ and .$\gamma$
- Using chip thickness to estimate .$\phi$, Can then use the relationship between .$\phi$ and .$\gamma$ from previous slide to estimate .$\gamma$ Merchant‚Äôs shear angle relationship
- Merchant‚Äôs shear angle relationship
    - We assume that shear stress equals the shear strength of the workpiece material in the shear plane, and that shear stresses are lower elsewhere in the material.
    - Also assume that the value of the shear angle .$\phi$ is naturally such that the shear strength, ùúèùúèùë¶ùë¶, of the workpiece material is reached in the shear plane at the lowest possible cutting force ùêπùêπùëêùëê.
    - If we know the material‚Äôs shear strength, the friction angle .$\beta$, and the shear angle .$\phi$, we can (roughly) estimate the required cutting force ùêπùêπùëêùëê.
    - Need to solve for .$\phi$ in terms of parameters we can control: .$\alpha$ (directly through tool geometry) and .$\beta$ (indirectly through lubrication).

    To find value of .$\phi$ for maximum shear stress at a given .$F_c$, set derivative .$\frac{d\tau}{d\phi}$ to zero and solve:

- To estimate .$\beta$, we can measure .$F_c$ and .$F_t$ and use the force-resolving circle, and then substitute into the expression for .$\phi$:
        <---><!-- mathjax fix -->
$$\tan(\beta - \alpha) = \frac{F_t}{F_c}$$
$$\beta = \arctan\bigg(\frac{F_t}{F_c}\bigg) + \alpha$$
        {{< /columns >}}
- Insights:
	- Increasing the rake angle .$\alpha$ (via tool design) and lowering friction angle .$\beta$ (by application of an appropriate lubricant/coolant ‚Äì e.g. water/oil mixture) both help to increase shear angle
	- However there are limits: for instance, if .$\alpha$ becomes too large, ùêπùêπùë°ùë° may become negative in which case the tool would dig into the workpiece and result in a very poor finish.
- This model is an approximation; alternative models exist Merchant‚Äôs circle: examples of process changes
- Merchant‚Äôs circle: examples of process changes
    - Increasing .$\alpha$? Decreasing .$\beta$?

### Cutting power

- Different workpiece materials are associated with different specific energies, .$U$ (J/mm.$^3$): the work that must be done per unit volume material removed.
- .$U$ approximately folds in work done in the shear plane, work done against friction, and mechanical losses in the lathe ‚Äì hence each material has a quite wide range for .$U$
    - Example values of .$U$ (J/mm.$^3$):
    - Aluminum alloys: 0.4 ‚Äì 1.1
    - Titanium alloys: 3.0 ‚Äì 4.1
    - Steels: 2.7 ‚Äì 9.3
- Expression linking .$U$, cutting power .$P_C$, and geometry:

- Taylor tool life equation:
$$VT^n = C$$
    - .$V$ = cutting speed
    - .$T$ = tool lifetime
    - .$n, C$ are empirical constants

### Surface roughness in machining

![](/docs/e-29/0/roughness.png)
    - Peak-to-valley roughness,
    - Example: .$R_n = 0.5 \text{ mm; } f = 0.1 \text{ mm:}$
    - Actual roughness will be up to 2-3 times worse than this ideal value: built-up edge, cracking, scratching from chips, etc

-  Types of milling
    - **Peripheral (a.k.a. plain) milling**
    	- Tool axis is parallel to surface being machined
    	- Slab, slotting, side milling, straddle, form
    - **Face milling**
    	- Tool axis is perpendicular to surface being machined
    	- Conventional, partial, end, profile, pocket, surface contouring

### Drilling
- [Drilling](https://youtu.be/bdD57NeOuio?t=127) 
    - You end up with scratches on the side wall when drilling
- Reaming
    - Reaming involves enlarge existing holes
    - Provide better tolerance and smoother finish than drilling 
    - Reaming tools: vertical flutes
