# Why use GD&T?

## Limitations of conventional tolerancing

>**Example:** four pins need to make a clearance fit with four holes
>> Tolerance limits on pin and hole spacing need to be specified
>![](/docs/e-29/11/lim1.png)
>
>>![](/docs/e-29/11/lim2.png)
>>* (Left) Tolerance zones for centers of holes
>>* (Right) What if a pin is positioned at the extreme edges of _both_ tolerance zones?
>>    * Case 1 is extreme along $x$
>>    * Case 2 is extreme along both $x$ and $y$

- In conventional tolerancing, tolerance zones are inherently one-dimensional
- In two- or three-dimensional designs, we risk accepting non-functional parts if each dimension is considered in isolation
- Options: tighten tolerances, enlarge clearance, _or_ use...
- [**GD&T**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_dimensioning_and_tolerancing): standard graphical language, [ASME Y14.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASME_Y14.5), that allows tolerances to be unambiguously defined on drawings
    - Allows different features to be related to each other (3D)
    - Specifies how measurements are set up and made with [datums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datum_reference)


# Datums

<!-- ## Purpose -->

## Theoretical datums

- Theoretical datums are defined on drawings using features of the component to be manufactured
- Datums can be
    - Planes (e.g. flat surfaces of the component) i.e after facing operations
    - Axes (e.g. axis of a hole or cylindrical feature) i.e when turning
- Every datum is given a letter on the drawing which uniquely identifies it
>**Example**: three perpendicular datum planes:
>![](/docs/e-29/11/perp.png)

## Datums in measurement

- Real manufactured objects deviate (even if slightly) from the ideal geometry
    - Surfaces not perfect planes
    - Axes not perfectly straight, etc
- So, we need a procedure to interpret measurements from a component to establish a "best fit" for the datum plane or axis
    - Use a physical "datum simulator" like a rigid, flat surface (e.g. granite table) to rest against the component
    - Measure multiple points $(x,y,z)$ with [CMM](10.md#electromechanical-systems-coordinate-measuring-machines-cmms) or [optical metrology](10.md#optical-interferometry-vs-contact-metrology) and fit the plane or axis datum in software (e.g. use least-squares regression -- advanced software available for this)
- The number of datums needed to define a given tolerance depends on the geometry of the component and the type of tolerance

## Example: Physical Planar Datum Simulators

- In measurement, we place a flat surface against the component as a datum simulator
    - Needs to be at least $\approx 10$ times smoother than the target surface
    - We measure wrt this datum rather than the part's features
- For any given dimension specified in GD&T, datums are defined with an order of preference. During measurement:
    - First plane makes three-point contact with surface
    - Second plane makes two-point contact
    - Third plane: one-point contact


# Introductory examples

## Example: hole in a block

>Surfaces are not smooth in a real part, so we measure the hole center from the datums $A,B,C$
>{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/block.png" >}}

## Example: hole spacing in plate

> Four pins need to make a clearance fit with four holes -- tolerance limits on pin and hole spacing need to be specified

## Center positions



### MMC: Maximum Material Condition
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Use when want **clearance**
- MMC means least "play" is available between the components
- Bonus tolerance is added if components are not in MMC.
- **Example**: if actual size of hole is .252" rather than .250", size of tolerance zone increases from .006" to .008" diameter

### LMC: Least Material Condition

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Use if want **interference**
- Or for, e.g., holes very close to the edge of a part
- Bonus tolerance now added if more material is left on component

# Categories of Tolerance

## Form Tolerances


### Straightness

#### 1 Straightness of an edge, or a line on a surface (top)
- Tolerance defined as the maximum distance between the closest two parallel lines including all points on the edge under consideration
    - Single dimensional value (no diameter symbol, Ø)
- Controls bowing, waisting, and barreling of cylindrical features

#### 2. Straightness of an axis (bottom)
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- **Cylindrical tolerance** zone must fit inside this diameter
    - Needs diameter symbol, Ø
- Compute axis position by forming an [equidistant set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidistant_set) by [bisecting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection) pairs of measured points on surface of the cylindrical feature
- Matters because we are generally trying to mate one cylindrical feature with another
    - e.g. peg and hole
- Note that a cylindrical feature can have a straight axis without having straight edges, as would be the case when a feature exhibits waisting or barreling.
    <---><!-- mathjax fix -->
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/straight.png" >}}
    {{< /columns >}}

### Flatness

![](/docs/e-29/11/form.png)

- 2D version of straightness -- applies only to planar feature
- To measure, we sample a series points on the surface (physical edge)
    - Can be accomplished with optical interferometry or the entire surface in one scan, or, approximately, by stylus profilometry -- e.g. by running a dial gage across the surface multiple times and measuring the needle deflection
- **Tolerance zone** is defined as the maximum allowable spacing between the closest two planes that enclose all points on the manufactured surface
    - Tells us nothing about relationship with any other surface
        - Not used, e.g. , to control thickness uniformity of a plate
- Disadvantage of using multiple linear measurements to check flatness is that the relative locations of these measurements are not known, so checking the flatness tolerance against the exact definition described above (maximum distance between two parallel planes) is then not strictly possible


### Circularity (Roundness)

![](/docs/e-29/11/round.png)

- Controls out-of-roundness within any plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder
- The **tolerance value** specifies the maximum allowable difference between radii of two concentric circles that are as close together as possible and that enclose all points of the manufactured circumference
    - Center position of circles is fit to measurement data to give minimal difference in radii (minimum zone circle)
        - To test this tolerance strictly, one would have to measure the shape of the circumference with stylus, and then use a data-fitting algorithm to identify the two circles with the smallest difference in radii that enclose all points
    - How far from perfectly circular any particular circumference of a cylindrical feature is allowed to be.
- In many machine shops, an approximate measure of circularity is often obtained by placing the component in a [V-block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-block) (right), and rotating it while a dial gage stylus rests on the upper surface.
    - The peak-to-peak, $\Delta d$, deflection of the gage needle is taken as an _estimate_ of out-of-roundness.

---

- When a __circularity__ tolerance is applied to a cylindrical feature, we require the tolerance to be independently met at all points along its axis.
- When we consider all longitudinal positions simultaneously, our tolerance is one of __cylindricity__:

### Cylindricity

![](/docs/e-29/11/cyl.png)

- '3D version' of circularity
- All points on surface of cylindrical feature must lie between two concentric cylinders separated by no more than the **tolerance value**
    - Axial position and orientation of cylinders is fit to measurement data to give minimal difference between radii (MZC: minimum zone cylinder)
    - Considers all points on the surface of the feature simultaneously

### Summary


{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/relate.png" >}}
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
- The range of acceptable material positions is contained by the tolerance zone:
    - 2D region for straightness/circularity
    - 3D region for flatness/cylindricity
{{< /columns >}}


## Profile

- Specify the allowable deviation of a line or surface from a perfect profile
    - Can be bilateral (equal or unequal), or unilateral
    - Can be specified with or without a datum reference
- Line profile tolerance example
    - Any line trace along the profile and parallel to its edges must satisfy the tolerance

{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/profile.png" >}}


### Surface profile tolerance

> {{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/surf.png" >}}
>
> All points on the indicated surface must lie within the tolerance zone, considered simultaneously

### Profile tolerances: with vs without datum

{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/comp.png" >}}

### Unilateral vs Bilateral

{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/uni.png" >}}

## Orientation tolerances

### Parallelism

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Can be applied to surfaces and axes
- **Surface parallelism**: all points must lie between two planes, separated by the tolerance value and parallel to the referenced datum
	- Parallelism is distinct from a distance tolerance
- The parallelism tolerance does not specify how far from the datum the tolerance zone lies
- Two surfaces could be parallel but the wrong distance apart
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/para.png" >}}
{{< /columns >}}


#### Axis

>{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/axiss.png" >}}
>
> All points on the axis must lie within a cylinder with the diameter of the tolerance zone and parallel to the referenced datum

### Establishing an axis datum

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- If the axis datum is the first datum being established: find best-fit center-line for points measured on the surface of the cylindrical feature (e.g. by CMM)
    - Best-fit could be found by minimizing, e.g. sum of squared differences from surface points to axis
- If other datum(s) have been previously established: the axis datum is also constrained to be perpendicular to previous datum(s)
    - Fitting process incorporates this constraint
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/axid.png" >}}
{{< /columns >}}


### Checking an axis tolerance

- Measure multiple points on the surface of the cylindrical manufactured feature
- Find the effective position of the axis at all points along its length
    - Find "median position" between measured surface points
    - Manufactured axis will not be perfectly straight

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Ask whether all points along the manufactured axis fit within a cylindrical tolerance zone of the specified diameter that has the prescribed relationship to the given datum:
    - Tolerance zone may be parallel, perpendicular, concentric, etc. relative to datum
    - Tolerance zone can take the most favorable possible position for meeting the tolerance
    - Applies along the whole length of the toleranced feature
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/check.png" >}}
{{< /columns >}}

### Perpendicularity

- Can be applied to surfaces and axes
- **Surface perpendicularity**: all points must lie between two planes, separated by the tolerance value and perpendicular to the referenced datum
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/perpe.png" >}}


#### Axes

> **Axis perpendicularity**: all points on the axis must lie within a cylinder with the diameter of the tolerance zone and perpendicular to the referenced datum
> {{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/perpa.png" >}}

### Angularity

{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- Traditional (non-GD&T) approach
    - Angular tolerance is specified as a number of degrees
    - Tolerance zone is wedge- shaped
- GD&T approach
    - Tolerance zone has parallel boundaries separated by the tolerance value
- What are some possible pros and cons of the two approaches?
<---><!-- mathjax fix -->
{{< figure  src="/docs/e-29/11/ang.png" >}}
{{< /columns >}}

## Location tolerances

## Concentricity

- Concentricity relates two axes
- One datum axis and one toleranced cylindrical feature
- All points on the axis of the tolerance feature must lie within a cylindrical tolerance zone centered on the datum axis

## Symmetry

- Relates two planar features
- All median points lying mid-way between the two surfaces of the toleranced feature must lie within the tolerance zone
- Tolerance zone is centered on the datum feature
- Tolerance zone defined by two planes

# Runout tolerances

## Circular runout

- Runout considers how the surface profile of an object varies as it rotates about a specified axis
- Useful for specifying performance of rotating machinery, cutting tools etc.
- **Circular runout**:
	- Imagine placing a dial gage on the surface of a cylindrical feature
- Peak-to-peak variation of the reading as it rotates is circular runout
- Circular runout tolerance must not be exceeded at any location along the axis of the feature

## Circular runout: planar features

- Can also apply to planar features perpendicular to specified datum axis
- Runout tolerance must not be exceeded at any radial location

## Cylindrical, or total, runout

- Total runout is more restrictive than circular runout
- Imagine taking dial gage readings at many locations along length of feature
- Gage readings referenced to the rotation axis (axis = 0)
- Peak-to-peak variation of all readings taken together must not exceed tolerance value
- This is unlike circular runout, where each axial location is independent

## Total runout for planar features

- Total runout can be applied to a planar feature perpendicular to the datum axis
- Tolerance value must not be exceeded when considering overall peak-to-peak positional variation of all radial locations together

## Multiple datums

- It is common for rotating components to be held in bearings at both ends
- Associate a datum feature with each end of the component
- Rotation axis for evaluating runout can be based on these two datums together
- Fit the axis to points measured along both datums
- Reflects operation of component more accurately
