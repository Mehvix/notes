# 16.1 Vector Fields

- A vector field in .$\mathbb{R}^3$ is a function .$\vec F$ on region .$E \in \mathbb{R}^3$ that assigns each point .$(x,y,z)$ a vector .$F(x,y,z)$
- .$\vec F$ is made up of **component function:** .$\vec F(x,y,z) = \langle P(x,y,z)\hat i, Q(x,y,z) \hat j, R(x,y,z) \hat k\rangle$
    - .$\vec F$ is continuos iff its component vectors are continuos
- .$\vec F$ is **[conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_vector_field)** (path taken doesn't change work) iff potential function .$f(x,y,z)$ is a partial of .$\vec F$
    $$\vec F = \nabla f$$
    - Notice that the gradient lines are always perpendicular to the [level sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set#/media/File:Himmelblau_contour.svg) 
        - If the function .$f$ is differentiable, .$\nabla f$ at a point is either zero or perpendicular to the level set of .$f$ at that point.
    - That is, that the gradient of a function is called a gradient field which is always conservative (the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals)
        - Conversely, a (continuous) conservative vector field is always the gradient of a function

# 16.2 Line Integrals

- We know that the distance (length) normally is .$L = \int_a^b \sqrt{(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2}\ dt$
- Over a vector field, we can think of the function being the density of the line (or height of particle). Therefore, we say .$ds = \int_a^b \sqrt{(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2}\ dt$ and can write
$$\int_C f(x,y) ds = \int_a^bf(x(t), y(t)) \cdot \sqrt{\bigg(\frac{dx}{dt}\bigg)^2 + \bigg(\frac{dy}{dt}\bigg)^2} dt$$
and for 3D in a slightly different form:
$$\int_a^b f (\vec r (t) ) \vert \vec r'(t) \vert \Longrightarrow \int_a^b f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) \cdot \sqrt{x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2 + z'(t)^2} dt$$
![Line Integral gif](/docs/math-53/imgs/line-int.gif)
- We can write .$\vec a \to \vec b$ as .$(1-t)\vec a + t\vec b$ with .$t\in[0,1]$
- Just like usual, we can break up un-integrable smooth curves, i.e
$$\int_a^z f (x,y) = \int_a^b f_1(x,y) + \int_b^c f_2(x,y) + \dots$$

## wrt variable

$$\int_C f(x,y) dx = \int_a^b f(x(t), y(t)) \cdot y'(t) dt$$
$$\int_C f(x,y) dy = \int_a^b f(x(t), y(t)) \cdot x'(t) dt$$

## Orientation

- When we parameterize a curve, we give it a direction
- The orientation represents the direction of the line
    - The positive direction corresponding to increasing values of the parameter .$t$
    - Doesn't matter for regular line integrals: .$\int_C f(x,y) ds = \int_C f(x,y) ds$
        - Deals with distance, .$ds$, which doesn't depend on direction
    - Does matter for field line integrals: .$\int_C f(x,y) dx \neq \int_C f(x,y) dy$
        - Deals with displacement, .$dx/dy$, which depends on direction


{{< hint "info" >}}
Let .$\vec F$ be a continuous vector field defined on a smooth curve .$C$ given by a vector function .$\vec r(t), t\in[a,b]$. Then the line integral of .$F$ along .$C$ is
$$\int_C \vec F \cdot d\vec r = \int_a^b \vec F ( \vec r (t) ) \cdot \vec r' (t) dt = \int_C \vec F \cdot \vec T ds$$
{{< /hint >}}

- Then, for a non-conservative force i.e .$F = \langle P(x,y,z), Q(x,y,z), R(x,y,z) \rangle$
$$W = \int_a^b P(\vec r(t)) \cdot x'(t) + Q(\vec r(t)) \cdot y'(t) + R(\vec r(t)) \cdot z'(t)$$
$$ \Longrightarrow \int_C P\ dx + Q\ dy + R\ dz$$

# 16.3 Fundamental Thm for Line Integrals

{{< hint "info" >}}
Let .$C$ be a smooth curve given by the vector function .$\vec r (t), t\in[a,b]$. Let .$f$ be a differentiable function of two or three variables whose gradient vector .$\nabla f$ is continuous on .$C$. Then
$$\int_C \nabla f \cdot d\vec r =\int_C \vec F \cdot d\vec r = f(\vec r(b) ) f(\vec r(a))$$

- That is, for conservative fields, path doesn't matter

Suppose .$\vec F$ is a vector field that is continuous on an **open connected** region .$D$. If .$\int_C \vec F \cdot d\vec r$ is _independent_ of path in .$D$, then .$\vec F$ is a conservative vector field on .$D$; that is, there exists a function .$f$ such that .$\nabla f = \vec F$.

If .$\vec F (x,y) = P(x,y) \hat i + Q(x,y) \hat j$ is a conservative vector field, where .$P$ and .$Q$ have continuous first-order partial derivatives on a domain .$D$, then throughout .$D$ we have
$$ \frac{\delta P}{\delta y} = \frac{\delta Q}{\delta x}$$

- The converse of the theorem above is true on only **simple curves**: curves that don’t intersect itself anywhere between its endpoints
- A **simply-connected** region in the plane is a connected region .$D$ such that every simple closed curve in .$D$ encloses only points that are in .$D$
    - Intuitively speaking, a simply-connected region contains no hole and can’t consist of two separate pieces.

.$\vec F = \langle P, Q \rangle$ is a conservative vector field on an open **simply-connected**
region .$D$ iff both .$P$ and .$Q$ have continuous first-order partial derivatives and
