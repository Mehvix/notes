# 14.1 Functions of Several Variables

- In the real world, most things don't depend on a single variable
    - Temperature may depend on the .$(x,y)$ (latitude/longitude) position 
    - Volume of a cylinder depends on radius .$r$ and height .$h$: .$V=\pi r^2 h$
- **Formal Definition**: A function .$f$ of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers .$(x,y)$ in a set .$D$ a unique real number denoted by .$f(x,y)$. The set .$D$ is the **domain** of .$f$ and its range is the set of values that .$f$ takes on, that is, .$\\{f(x,y)\ |\ (x,y) \in D \\}$.
    - E.x. for .$f(x,y) = \frac{\sqrt{x+y+1}}{x-1}$, the domain is .$D= \\{(x,y)\ |\ x + y + 1 \geq 0, x \neq 1\\}$ which can be graphed with a *solid* line following .$y=-x-1$ with a *dotted* line at .$x=1$
    - E.x. for .$f(x,y) = x\ln(y^2-x)$, the domain is .$D=\\{(x,y)\ |\ x<y^2\\}$. This can be graphed with a *dotted* line following the curve .$x = y^2$
- For the equation .$z = f(x,y)$, .$x,y$ are the independent variables and .$z$ is the dependent variable -- similar to single variable equations
- We can visualize functions of two variables (i.e .$f(x,y)$) by graphing them in 3D as .$(x,y,f(x,y))$
    - We can then write **level curves** for the function by setting .$f(x,y) = k$ for some .$k$onstant in the range of .$f$. This will result in a graph similar to a [Topographic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map)

**Level Curve:** The level curves of a function .$f$ of two variables are the curves with equations .$f(x,y) = k$, where .$k$ is a constant (in the range of .$f$).

# 14.2 Limits and Continuity

## Limits

![Vector Limit](/docs/math-53/imgs/vec-limit.png)
{{< hint info >}}
**Vector Limit:** Let .$f$ be a function of two variables whose domain .$D$ includes points arbitrarily close to .$(a, b)$. Then we say that the **limit of** .$f(x, y)$ **as** .$(x, y)$ **approaches** .$a, b.$ is .$L$ and we write
$$\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y) = L$$
if for every number .$\varepsilon < 0$ there is a corresponding number .$\delta < 0$ such that if .$(x, y) \in D$ and .$0 < \sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2} < \delta$ then .$\vert f(x,y) - L \vert < \varepsilon$
{{< /hint >}}
- Notice that .$\vert f(x,y) - L \vert$ is the distance between the numbers .$f(x, y)$ and .$L$, and
.$\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2}$ is the distance between the point .$(x, y)$ and the point .$(a, b)$.
- If .$f(x,y) \to L_1$ as .$(x,y) \to (a,b)$ along a path .$C_1$ and .$f(x,y) \to L_2$ as .$(x,y) \to (a,b)$ along a path .$C_2$, where .$L_1 \neq L_2$, then .$\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y)$, does
not exist.
    - We can test this by setting .$x$ and .$y$ to various different values (e.x. .$x=0, y=0, x=y, ...,$ etc)


## Continuity

{{< hint info >}}
A function .$f$ of two variables is called continuous at .$(a,b)$ if 
$$\lim_{(x,y)\to (a,b)} f(x,y) = f(a,b)$$
We say .$f$ is continuous on .$D$ if .$f$ is continuous at every point .$(a,b)$ in .$D$.
{{< /hint >}}
- That is, we need the limit to exist ands for .$f(a,b)$ to be defined
- Continuos functions: .$x,y, c, \text{ trig (on domain)}$
- Arithmetic, composition, exponent all preserve continuity (on domain!)
- Dividing doesn't necessarily preserve continuity

# 14.3 Partial Derivatives

{{< hint info >}}
If .$f$ is a function of two variables, its **partial derivatives** are the functions .$f_x$ and .$f_y$ defined by
$$f_x(x,y) = \frac{\delta f}{\delta x} = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x+h,y)-f(x,y)}{h}$$
$$f_y(x,y) = \frac{\delta f}{\delta y} = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x,y+h)-f(x,y)}{h}$$
{{< /hint >}}
- Notice we use .$\delta$ instead of .$d$ for *partial* derivatives
- These can be written at a single point .$(a,b)$ with respect to .$x$ and .$y$ by treating the remaining variables as a constant
$$f_x(a,b) = g'(a); \ \ \ g(x) = f(x,b)$$
$$f_y(a,b) = h'(b); \ \ \ h(y) = f(a,y)$$
- Which can be extrapolated for 3 (or more) variables:
$$f_z(a,b,c) = k'(c); \ \ \ k(z) = f(a,b,z)$$

## Higher Derivatives

- Just like regular derivatives, we can do many partial derivatives
- For example, the following are **second partial derivatives** of .$z=f(x,y)$:
$$(f_x)\_x = f_{xx} = \frac{\delta }{\delta x}\bigg(\frac{\delta f}{\delta x}\bigg) = \frac{\delta^2f}{\delta x^2}$$
$$(f_x)\_y = f_{xy} = \frac{\delta }{\delta y}\bigg(\frac{\delta f}{\delta x}\bigg) = \frac{\delta^2f}{\delta y \delta x}$$
$$(f_y)\_x = f_{yx} = \frac{\delta }{\delta x}\bigg(\frac{\delta f}{\delta y}\bigg) = \frac{\delta^2f}{\delta x \delta y}$$
$$(f_y)\_y = f_{yy} = \frac{\delta }{\delta y}\bigg(\frac{\delta f}{\delta y}\bigg) = \frac{\delta^2f}{\delta y^2}$$

{{< hint info >}}
**Clairautâ€™s Theorem** Suppose .$f$ is defined on a disk .$D$ that contains the point .$(a,b)$. If the functions .$f_{xy}$ and .$f_{yx}$ are both continuous on .$D$, then 
$$f_{xy}(a,b) = f_{yx}(a,b)$$

## Partial Differential Equations

- In the sciences, we typically want to find how a system changes with respect to multiple variables
- Partial derivatives occur in partial differential equations, e.x **Laplace's Equation**:
    $$ \frac{\delta^2 u}{\delta x^2} + \frac{\delta^2 u}{\delta y^2} = 0$$ 
    - Solutions to Laplace's are always harmonic functions, such as .$u=e^x \sin(y)$

# 14.4 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations

## Tangent Planes

- Tangent planes are to surfaces as tangent lines are to curves
    - Tangent planes contain both the partial derivative lines w.r.t .$x$ and .$y$
- All we need to know to write a tangent plane is a point .$(a,b)$ and direction of the two partial derivatives .$\langle 1,0, f_x(a,b)\rangle, \langle 0,1, f_y(a,b)\rangle$
    - Direction vector can be found with .$\langle 1,0, f_x(a,b)\rangle \times \langle 0,1, f_y(a,b)\rangle = \langle -f_x, -f_y, 1 \rangle$ which we can dot with .$\langle x-x_0, y-y_0, z-f(x_0,y_0) \rangle$

{{< hint info >}}
Suppose .$f$ has continuous partial derivatives. An equation of the tangent plane to the surface .$z = f(x, y)$ at the point .$P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is
$$z-f(x_0, y_0) = f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y-y_0)$$
{{< /hint >}}

## Linear Approximations

- As we get very close to the surface, then the tangent plane (at point .$(a,b)$) looks more and more like the surface
    - Thus, we can use it to for making approximations when we are near near .$(a,b)$
{{< hint info >}}
If .$z=f(x,y)$, then .$f$ is differentiable at .$(a,b)$ if .$\Delta z$ can be expressed in the form
$$\Delta z = f_x(a,b)\Delta x +  f_y(a,b)\Delta y + \varepsilon_1 \Delta x + \varepsilon_2 \Delta y$$
where the error terms, .$\varepsilon_1$ and .$\varepsilon_2 \to 0$ as .$(\Delta x, \Delta y) \to (0,0)$.
{{< /hint >}}
- Rewriting this, we can use the given .$f(x,y,z)$ to write an estimate for point/state .$f(a,b,c)$
$$f(x,y,z) \approx f(a,b,c) + f_x(a,b,c) (x-a) + f_y(a,b,c)(y-b) + f_z(a,b,c) (z-c)$$

## Differentials

- With one variable functions, i.e. .$y=f(x)$, we defined the differential .$dx$ to be independent so we had to write .$dy$ as .$dy = f'(x)\ dx$
- Given a differentiable function of two variables, i.e. .$z=f(x,y)$, we know both .$dx$ and .$dy$ are independent so we write:
$$dz = f_x(x,y)\ dx + f_y(x,y)\ dy = \frac{\delta z}{\delta x}dx + \frac{\delta z}{\delta y}dy$$
- If the partial derivatives .$f_x$ and .$f_y$ exist near .$(a,b)$ and are continuous at .$(a,b)$, then .$f$ is differentiable at .$(a,b)$.
