# 14.1 Functions of Several Variables

- In the real world, most things don't depend on a single variable
    - Temperature may depend on the .$(x,y)$ (latitude/longitude) position 
    - Volume of a cylinder depends on radius .$r$ and height .$h$: .$V=\pi r^2 h$
- **Formal Definition**: A function .$f$ of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers .$(x,y)$ in a set .$D$ a unique real number denoted by .$f(x,y)$. The set .$D$ is the **domain** of .$f$ and its range is the set of values that .$f$ takes on, that is, .$\\{f(x,y)\ |\ (x,y) \in D \\}$.
    - E.x. for .$f(x,y) = \frac{\sqrt{x+y+1}}{x-1}$, the domain is .$D= \\{(x,y)\ |\ x + y + 1 \geq 0, x \neq 1\\}$ which can be graphed with a *solid* line following .$y=-x-1$ with a *dotted* line at .$x=1$
    - E.x. for .$f(x,y) = x\ln(y^2-x)$, the domain is .$D=\\{(x,y)\ |\ x<y^2\\}$. This can be graphed with a *dotted* line following the curve .$x = y^2$
- For the equation .$z = f(x,y)$, .$x,y$ are the independent variables and .$z$ is the dependent variable -- similar to single variable equations
- We can visualize functions of two variables (i.e .$f(x,y)$) by graphing them in 3D as .$(x,y,f(x,y))$
    - We can then write **level curves** for the function by setting .$f(x,y) = k$ for some .$k$onstant in the range of .$f$. This will result in a graph similar to a [Topographic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map)
