# 23.1 Electric Potential Energy and Difference

- PE can only be defined for conservative forces
    - That is, work done by said force is independent of the path taken
    - [Coulomb’s Law](21.md#215-coulombs-law) is conservative because the dependence on position is conservative
- Hence, we define .$\Delta U = -W$ with
    - .$\Delta U = U_b - U_a$ is for a situation where a point charge .$q$ moves from point .$a$ to point .$b$
    - This is equal to negative work, .$-W = -\vec F d = -(q\vec E) d$ -- (for a uniform .$\vec E$)


# 23.2 Relation between Electric Potential and Field

- **Electric Potential:** Electric PE per unit charge, such as for a charge at point .$a$
$$V_a = \frac{U_a}{q}$$
- We only really care about difference though, which is defined as 
$$V_{ba} = \Delta V = \frac{U_b - U_a}{q} = - \frac{W_{ba}}{q}$$
- We can now also define PE in terms of electric potential:
$$\Delta U = U_b - U_a = q(V_b - V_a) = qV_{ba}$$
- Electric potential difference is a measure of how much energy an electric charge can acquire in a given situation. 
- Since energy is the ability to do work, the electric potential difference is also a measure of how much work a given charge can do. 
    - The exact amount of energy or work depends both on the _potential difference_ and on _the charge_.
- If a positive charge is free, it will tend to move from high to low potential
    - Inverse for opposite charge

# 23.3 Potential due to Point Charges

$$\Delta U = U_b - U_a = - \int_a^b \vec F \cdot d \vec l$$
- .$dl$ is an infinitesimal increment of displacement along the path from .$a$ to .$b$ 
    - Keep in mind that .$\vec F$ must be conservative
    - Thus the integral can be taken along any path from point .$a$ to point .$b$.
- Knowing .$\vec E = \vec F / q$ and .$V_{ba} = (U_b - U_a) / q$, we can write the electric potential equation as...

$$V_{ba} = V_b - V_a = - \int_a^b \vec E \cdot d \vec l$$
$$V_{ba, \text{uniform $\vec E$}} = -E\int_a^b d\vec l = -Ed$$

## Charged Conducting Sphere

### 1. Electric Potential **Outside** Sphere
- We know .$\vec E = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r^2}$ for outside a conducting sphere (.$r > r_0$)
- Therefore, we can write
$$V_{ba} = - \int_{r_a}^{r_b} \vec E \cdot d \vec l = - \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\int_{r_a}^{r_b} \frac{dr}{r^2}$$
$$\dots = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \bigg(\frac{1}{r_b} - \frac{1}{r_a}\bigg)$$
$$\dots = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r} \text{    [$r_b = \infty$]}$$

### 2. Electric Potential **On** Sphere
- From .$(a)$, as .$r$ approaches .$r_0$, we see
$$V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r_0}$$
at the surface of the sphere. This makes sense because the charge is distributed on the surface of the sphere.
<--->
### 3. Electric Potential **Inside** Sphere
- Inside the conductor, .$\vec E = 0$
- Therefore, there is no change in .$\vec E$ from .$0$ to .$r_0$ (or any point within the conductor) gives zero change in .$V$
- Hence, within the conductor, .$V$ is a constant:
$$V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r_0}$$
{{< /columns >}}
- Thus, the whole conductor, not just its surface, is at this same potential.
- We can also generalize the first case to the electric potential .$r$ from a **single point charge** .$Q$


## Coulomb potential
- The potential outside a uniformly charged sphere is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at its center

> The potential near a positive charge is large, and it decreases toward zero at very large distances

> For a negative charge, the potential is negative and increases toward zero at large distances

# 23.4 Potential due to Any Charge Distribution

- If .$\vec E$ is a function of position (or otherwise unknown), we can find .$V$ by calculating the potential due to the many tiny charges that make up .$\vec E$:
$$V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \int \frac{dq}{r}$$
where .$r$ is the distance from a tiny element of charge .$dq$ to the point where .$V$ is being determined

# 23.5 Equipotential Lines and Surfaces

- The electric potential can be represented by drawing **equipotential lines**, or, in three dimensions, **equipotential surfaces**
- An equipotential surface has all points at the same potential. 
    - That is, the potential difference between any two points on the surface is zero
    - Thus, no work is required to move a charge from one point on the surface to another.
- Equipotential surfaces are perpendicular to the electric field (field lines)
- For a _positive_ point charge, the equipotential surface with the largest potential is closest to the _positive_ charge
- Unlike electric field lines, which start and end on electric charges, equipotential lines/surfaces are always continuous and never end

# 23.6 Potential Due to Dipole (Moment)

$$V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r} + \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{(-Q)}{(r+\Delta r)} = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{\Delta r}{r(r + \Delta r)}$$

- .$r$ is the distance from (some arbitrary point) .$P$ to the positive charge and .$r + \Delta r$ is the distance to the negative charge
{{< columns >}}
- If .$r \gg l$, then .$r \gg \Delta r \approx l \cos \theta$ so we can neglect .$\Delta r$
$$V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Ql \cos\theta}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{p \cos\theta}{r^2} $$
- Notice the potential decreases .$\propto r^2$, whereas for a single point charge the potential decreases .$\propto r$
- It is not surprising that the potential should fall off faster for a dipole:
    - When you are far from a dipole, the two equal but opposite charges appear so close together as to tend to neutralize each other

# 23.7 .$\vec E$ Determined from .$V$

- We know that .$V_b - V_a = - \int_a^b \vec E \cdot d\vec l$, which we can write in differential form as .$dV = -\vec E \cdot d\vec l = - E_l dl$. This can be written as

$$E_l = - \frac{dV}{dl}$$
- .$dV$ is the tiny difference in potential between two points a distance .$dl$ apart, and .$E_l$ is the component of the electric field in the direction of the tiny displacement .$d\vec l$
- This is called the gradient of .$V$ in a particular direction: The general case is 
$$\vec E = - \vec \nabla V = - \bigg\langle \frac{\delta V}{\delta x}, \frac{\delta V}{\delta y}, \frac{\delta V}{\delta z} \bigg\rangle$$


# 23.8 Electrostatic PE; The Electron Volt

- The electric potential and energy potential due to one point charge .$Q_1$ on another point charge .$Q_2$ separated by .$r_{12}$ are
$$V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_1}{r_{12}}$$
$$U = Q_2 V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r_{12}}$$
- The PE is the negative work needed to separate the two charges to infinity.

- For three points, we can use the superposition principle like we have prior to write
$$U = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\bigg( \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r_{12}}+ \frac{Q_1 Q_3}{r_{13}} + \frac{Q_2 Q_3}{r_{23}} \bigg)$$

## Electron Volt

- Joules are a very large unit for dealing with energy of the electron scale; as such, the **electron volt** (.$eV$) is often used
- One electron volt is the energy acquired by a particle carrying a charge .$e$ (the magnitude of an electron) as a result of moving through a potential difference of .$1 V$
$$1 \text{ eV} = 1.6022 \cdot 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$
- E.x., an electron (charge .$e = 1.6\cdot10^{-19}$) that accelerates through a potential difference of .$1000 \text{ V}$ will lose .$1000 \text{ eV}$ of potential energy and gain .$1000 \text{ eV}$ of kinetic energy


# 23.9 Digital; Binary Numbers; Signal Voltage (not covered)

- Batteries and wall sockets provide a steady **supply voltage** as _power_
- **Signal voltage** provide/carry _information_
    - **Analog** signal voltage has voltage that varies continuously (i.e .$\sin$)
    - **Digital** signals are more complicated and encode information, often in binary
        - Bytes have 8 bits which allow .$2^8 = 256$ numbers
        - Digital signals are transmitted at some rate (bit-rate) given in .$\text{Mb/s}$

{{< columns >}}
- Analog to digital converters, ADCs, convert analog signals to boxy digital waves
    - The difference between the original continuous and it's digital approximation is called the **quantization error / loss**
    - This error varies by primarily:
        1. **Resolution** or **bit depth** which is the number of bits for the voltage of each sample
        2. **Sampling rate** which is the number of times per second the original analog voltage is measured (sampled)
    - E.x., CDs are sampled at .$44.1 \text{ kHz}$ with a bit depth of .$16 \text{ bits per sample}$

- Digital Signals
    - Digital to Analog, DACs, exist too because some appliances require an analog signal
    - Digital signals can be compressed: Repeated information can be reduced so that less memory (bits) is needed
        - Fun fact: Bit is the contraction of "**b**inary dig**it**", leaving out the 8 letters between
    - Digital signals are more resistant from noise, which badly corrupts analog signals
        - Any electronic signal involves electric charges whose electric field can affect charges in another nearby signal
        - External fields, as from high voltage wires, motors, or fluorescent lamps, can produce noise
        - Thermal noise refers to random motion of electrons, much like the “thermal motion” of the molecules in a gas
        - Moving electrons can be affected by the medium (wire, etc.), altering the signal
