# 25.1 The Electric Battery

- Batteries produce electricity by transforming chemical energy into electric energy
- Simple battery (cells) contain two plates or rods of dissimilar metals called **electrodes**
    - The portion of rods outside of the solution are called the terminals 
    - **Anode:** The positive electrode
    - **Cathode:** The negative electrode
- These electrodes are emersed in the **electrolyte:** a solution such as a dilute acid

**Chemical Process:** 
1. The acid dissolve the zinc electrode, causing zinc atoms to leave two electrons behind on the electrode and enters the solution as a positive ion. The zinc electrode thus acquires a _negative charge_. 
2. Then the electrolyte becomes positively charged and can pull electrons off the carbon electrode. Thus the carbon electrode becomes _positively charged_. 
3. Because there is an opposite charge on the two electrodes, there is a _potential difference_ between the two terminals.

- When a battery isn't connected, only a small amount of zinc is dissolved 
    - The zinc electrode becomes increasingly negative
    - Thus, any new positive zinc ions produced are attracted back to the electrode
- That is, if a charge is allowed to flow then the zinc can dissolve
- The voltage depends ot the electrodes' material and their relative ability to give up electrons

# 25.2 Electric Current

{{< columns >}}
- When a circuit is formed, charge can move (flow) through the wires from one terminal to the other
    - Any flow of charge is called an **electric current**
    - Flow can only occur on a continuos conducting path (a complete circuit)
    - If there's any break, our circuit is called an open circuit and no current flows
- The symbol for battery is the following:

>Conventional current from .$+$ to .$-$  is equivalent to a negative electron flow from .$-$ to .$+$
![Flow Direction](/docs/physics-7b/imgs/flow-direction.gif)
{{< /columns >}}
- Current in a wire is defined as the net amount of charge that passes through the wire's full cross section at any point in time:
$$\bar I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} \Longrightarrow I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$$
- Current is measured in coulombs per second; ampere (amp): .$\text{1 A = 1 C/s}$

# 25.3 Ohm's Law: Resistance and Resistors

- For a current to exist, there must be a potential difference (e.g. between the terminals of a battery)
- That is, the current is proportional to the potential difference:
$$I \propto V$$
    - E.x., a wire connected to a .$6V$ battery results in a current twice that of a .$3V$ battery
- The current depends on the resistance that the wires offers
    - The electron flow is impeded partly due to the atoms in the wire
    - .$R$ is this proportionality factor between voltage and current
    - Thus, we get **Ohm's Law:**
    $$V=IR$$ 
- Ohm's law only works for when .$R$ is a constant, i.e a metal conductor
    - In reality, .$R$ isn't constant if temperature changes much
    - Materials that follow Ohm's law are labeled as "ohmic" 
    - Resistance has the units/notation .$\text{1 $\Omega$ = 1 V/A}$
- Resistors are used to limit/control the current in a circuit
- [toolbox.mehvix.com/resistor](https://toolbox.mehvix.com/resistor/)
- As a current passes through a resistor, the charge/current stays the same but the electric potential decreases

**Clarifications of Behavior**
- Current's magnitude depends on that device's resistance
    - Can be though of as the "response" to the voltage: increases if voltage increases or resistance decreases
    - Current is constant -- it's energy so it cannot be destroyed by components and it's not created by a battery
- Resistance is a property of the device/wire
- Voltage is external to the wire of device -- it's applied across the two ends of the wire
    - Batteries maintain a constant potential difference -- act as a source of voltage

# 25.4 Resistivity

- Resistivity has experimentally been found as 
    $$R = \rho \frac{l}{A}$$
    - .$\rho$ is the **resistivity** (constant of proportionality) and depends on the material
        - Has units .$\Omega \cdot \text{m = V/A $\cdot $ m}$
    - .$l$ is the wire length
    - .$A$ is the cross-section area
- The reciprocal of resistivity is **conductivity**: .$\sigma = \rho^{-1}$

## Temperature

- Resistivity varies (generally increasing) with temperature
    $$\rho_T = \rho_0 = \bigg[ 1+ \alpha (T-T_0)\bigg]$$
    - .$\rho_0$ is the resistivity at some reference temperature .$T_0$ (i.e .$0^\circ \text{ C}$)
    - .$\rho_T$ is the new resistivity at the current (higher) temperature .$T$
    - .$\alpha$ is the **temperature coefficient of resistivity** that depends on material
- Note that the temperature coefficient for semiconductors can be negative. 
    - At higher temperatures, some of the electrons that are normally not free in a semiconductor can become free and contribute to the current. 
    - Thus, the resistance of a semiconductor can decrease with an increase in temperature.
