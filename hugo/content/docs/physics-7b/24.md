# 24.1 Capacitors

- Capacitors are devices that store an electric charge
    - Normally consists of two conducting objects; plates, sheets
        - When a voltage is applied, the two plates become charged: one positive, one negative
    - Conductors are placed near one another, but not touching
        - This distance is typically due to an insulator between sheets
        - Capacitors are typically rolled so that they take up less room
- Two main use cases
    1. Storing energy for later use; e.x. camera flash
    2. Block surges of charge and energy to protect circuits
- The amount of charge .$Q$ acquired by each plate is proportional to 
    1. .$V$: The potential difference of the two plates (Volts) 
    2. .$C$: The constant [capacitance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance) of the capacitor (Coulombs per volt -- farad)
$$Q=CV$$

# 24.2 Determination of Capacitance

- In the real world, capacitance is determined experimentally by using the prior equations
- For ideal cases where the sheets are separated by a vacuum or air, however, we can use the following equations 
- For a parallel-plate capacitor where .$A$ is the area of each plate and .$d$ is the distance between plates:
    $$E = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0}$$
    - We also know this because .$E = \sigma / \varepsilon_0$ and .$\sigma = Q/A$
- Since .$V = \int E\ dl = \frac{Qd}{\varepsilon_0 A}$, we can relate it to .$C$ as
$$C = \frac{Q}{V} = \varepsilon_0 \cdot \frac{A}{d}$$


# 24.3 Capacitors in Series and Parallel

## Parallel

- Voltage (potential difference) is the same across all paths/capacitors
$$Q = Q_1 + Q_2 + \dots = C_1 V + C_2 V + \dots$$
- Therefore, we can write the equivalent capacitance equation as
$$Q = C_\text{eq} V = (C_1 + \dots)V \Longrightarrow C_\text{eq} = C_1 + \dots$$
- The net effect of connecting capacitors in parallel is to increase the capacitance
    - Makes sense: We're essentially increasing area of the plates

## Series

- The charge on each capacitor has the same magnitude .$Q$
- The total voltage across all capacitors is the sum:
$$V = V_1 + V_2 + \dots$$
- And since .$V = Q/C$, then 
$$ \frac{Q}{C_\text{eq}} = \frac{Q}{C_1} + \frac{Q}{C_2} + \dots \Longrightarrow \frac{1}{C_\text{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \dots $$
- Notice that the equivalence capacitance is smaller than the smallest contributing capacitance


<!-- TODO tmrw add more abt parallel/series ex. images and clarify voltage -->
