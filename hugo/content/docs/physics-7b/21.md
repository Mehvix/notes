# 21.1 Static Electricity; Electric Charge and its Conservation

- "Charged" objects posses a net electric charge
- Unlike charges attract; like charges repel
    - Charges on glass are positive, charges on plastic is negative
- **Law of Conservation of Electric Charge**: Whenever a certain amount of charge is produced in one object, an equal amount of the opposite type of charge is produced in another object
    - E.x. a plastic ruler is rubbed with a paper towel. The plastic acquires a _negative_ charge and the towel obtains an equal _positive_ charge
    - In other words, the net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero

# 21.2 Electric Charge in the Atom

- Atoms are made up of positive nucleus surrounded by at least one negatively charged electron.
    - Inside the nucleus are protons which are positively charged and neutrons which have no charge
    - The charges of electrons and protons are equal in magnitude
- E.x. neutral atoms with no charge contain an equal number of protons and electrons
- When an atom gains a charge (by losing/gaining electrons), it then has a net charge and is called an **ion**
- **Neutral** objects have a net charge of zero
    - Over time, objects left alone with a charge tend to lose their charge
    - This is because over time, electrons are exchanged with water molecules in the air 
        - Water molecules are **polar**: They are neutral, their charges aren't equally distributed
    - Thus, on rainy days it's harder for an object to maintain a charge for too long

# 21.3 Insulators and Conductors

- **Conductor:** Material that allows charge to flow between objects
    - Metals tend to be good conductors
    - Electrons are relatively lose: can move freely within metal, but can't leave easily
        - Called *free* or *conduction* electrons
- **Insulator:** Opposite of conductors; don't easily allow a flow of charge
    - Most materials other than metals tend to be good insulators
        - Notably rubber and wood
    - Electrons are bound very tightly to the nuclei
    - Almost no free electrons
- **Semiconductors:** Somewhere between the two former
    - Silicon, germanium
    - Less free electrons than a conductor, but more than an insulator

# 21.4 Induced Charge; Electroscope

- **Conduction:** Charge transfer by physical contact 
    - E.x. a positively charged metal rod touches a neutral metal rod. Free electrons from the neutral rod will then flow to the charged rod, leaving the formerly neutral rod now slightly positively charged
- **Induction:** Charge distribution altered by bringing two objects close, but not touching
- Grounded Objects
    - Objects can be ground to the earth with a conducting wire
    - The earth is very large and can conduct, so it easily accepts/gives up electrons
    - Therefore, when an object is induced by another charged object, the original objects will become charged
    - If the wire is ever cut when the object is under induction, the charge will stay in the object

# 21.5 Coulomb's Law

{{< hint info >}}
**Coulomb's Law:**
$$F = k \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$$
where .$k$ is a constant equal to .$8.988 \cdot 10^9 \text{ N m$^2$/C$^2$}$
{{< /hint >}}

- Very similar to [universal gravitation equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation)
    - However, gravity is always attractive whereas charges can repel
- The coulomb (.$\text{C}$) is the SI unit for charge
- The smallest charge we've observed is the elementary charge: .$e = 1.6022 \cdot 10^{-19} \text{ C}$
    - Electrons have a charge equal to .$-e$
    - Protons have a charge equal to .$+e$
    - Ideally, all charges are multiples of .$e$
- .$k$ can also be written as .$\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}$
    - .$\varepsilon_0$ is called the [permittivity of free space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity) 
    - .$\varepsilon_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi k} = 8.85 \cdot 10^{-12} \text{C$^2$/N m$^2$}$


# 21.6 Electric Field

- Electric fields extend outward from every charge and permeates all of space 
$$\overrightarrow E = \lim_{q\to0}\frac{\overrightarrow F}{q}$$
    - .$q$ is a positive charge
    - .$\overrightarrow F$ is the forces the field exserts on .$q$
    - Has units newtons per coulomb (.$\text{N/C}$)
- We can combine this with Coulomb's law to get
    $$\overrightarrow E = \frac{kqQ/r^2}{q} = k \frac{Q}{r^2}$$
    - We see that .$\overrightarrow E$ is independent of the particle .$q$
    - .$Q$ is the particle that is responsible for the field in the first place 
- An electric field at a given point is the sum of all other electric fields that act on that point
    $$\overrightarrow E = \overrightarrow E_1 + \overrightarrow E_2 + ...$$
# 21.7 Electric Field Calculations for Continuous Charge Distributions

- We can extend our previous definition to calculus as
$$\overrightarrow E = \int d \overrightarrow E$$
- When solving problems, it's a good idea to use symmetry, check charge direction, and (when applicable) use bounds of .$r \in [0, \infty]$
- This chapters has lots of good conceptual examples 
- We can write equation for an infinite plane holding a uniform surface charge density .$\sigma$
    $$\overrightarrow E = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}$$
    - This also applies in the case where a charge is close to an infinite surface (so that the distance to the surface is much greater than the distance to the edges)

# 21.8 Field Lines
{{< columns >}} <!-- begin -->

- To visualize electric fields, we draw **electric field lines** or **lines of force**
- Three properties of Electric Field Lines:
    1. Electric field lines indicate the direction of the electric field; the field points in the direction tangent to the field line at any point -- see point .$P$ in .$\text{(a)}$
    2. The lines are drawn so that the magnitude of the electric field, .$E$, is proportional to the number of lines crossing unit area perpendicular to the lines. The closer together the lines, the stronger the field.
    3. Electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges; and the number starting or ending is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.
- In the case of two oppositely charged parallel & equally spaces plates -- such as case .$\text{(d)}$ -- we can write the field as
    $$E=\text{const} = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}=\frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0 A}$$
    - .$Q=\sigma A$ is the charge on one plate of area .$A$
- Field lines never cross because it wouldn't make sense for an electric field to have two directions at the same point.

### **Electric Dipole**
- A combination of two equal but opposite charges next to one another -- .$(\text{a})$
- [Dipole Moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_dipole_moment) is when represented by vector .$\overrightarrow{p}$ of magnitude .$Ql$
    - Molecules that have dipole moments are called **polar molecules**
- A dipole in a uniform electric field feels no net force, but does have a net torque (unless .$\vec p \parallel \vec E$)
- If .$\vec p \not \parallel \vec E$, .$W=\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \tau d\theta$ where .$\tau = -\vec p\vec E\sin\theta$ 
    - Simplifies to .$W=\vec p\vec E(\cos\theta_2 - \cos\theta_1)$
    - Thus, work/torque is most at .$\theta = 90^\circ$ or .$180^\circ$ depending on .$\overrightarrow E$ direction
    - Pay attention to right hand rule when solving
- If .$r \gg l \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow E \propto 1/r^3$

# 21.9 Electric Fields and Conductors

- The static electric field inside a conductor is zero (in static situations where electrons have had time to stop moving)
    - For that reason, any net charge on a conductor distributes itself on the surface
    - Charges inside conductors act as if the conductor isn't there
- All the electric field lines just outside a charged conductor are perpendicular to the surface
