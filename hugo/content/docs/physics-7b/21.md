# 21.1 Static Electricity; Electric Charge and its Conservation

- "Charged" objects posses a net electric charge
- Unlike charges attract; like charges repel
    - Charges on glass are positive, charges on plastic is negative
- **Law of Conservation of Electric Charge**: 
    - Whenever a certain amount of charge is produced in one object, an equal amount of the opposite type of charge is produced in another object
        - Charges cannot be destroyed or created
    - E.x. a plastic ruler is rubbed with a paper towel. The plastic acquires a _negative_ charge and the towel obtains an equal _positive_ charge
    - In other words, the net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero: .$\Sigma Q = 0$

# 21.2 Electric Charge in the Atom

- Atoms are made up of positive nucleus surrounded by at least one negatively charged electron.
    - Inside the nucleus are protons which are positively charged and neutrons which have no charge
    - The charges of electrons and protons are equal in magnitude
- E.x. neutral atoms with no charge contain an equal number of protons and electrons
- When an atom gains a charge (by losing/gaining electrons), it then has a net charge and is called an **ion**
- **Neutral** objects have a net charge of zero
    - Over time, objects left alone with a charge tend to lose their charge
    - This is because over time, electrons are exchanged with water molecules in the air 
        - Water molecules are **polar**: They are neutral, their charges aren't equally distributed
    - Thus, on rainy days it's harder for an object to maintain a charge for too long

# 21.3 Insulators and Conductors

- **Conductor:** Material that *allow* charge to flow between objects
    - Metals tend to be good conductors
    - Electrons (charges) are *relatively lose*: can move freely within metal, but can't leave easily
        - Called *free* or *conduction* electrons
- **Insulator:** Opposite of conductors; *don't easily allow a flow of charge*
    - Most materials other than metals tend to be good insulators
        - Notably rubber and wood
    - Electrons are *bound very tightly* to the nuclei
    - Almost no free electrons
- **Semiconductors:** Somewhere between the two former
    - Silicon, germanium
    - Less free electrons than a conductor, but more than an insulator

# 21.4 Induced Charge; Electroscope

- **Conduction:** Charge transfer by physical contact 
    - E.x. a positively charged metal rod touches a neutral metal rod. Free electrons from the neutral rod will then flow (transfer) to the charged rod, *leaving the formerly neutral rod now slightly positively charged*
- **Induction:** Charge distribution altered by bringing two objects close, but not touching
    - Unlike conduction, induction doesn't alter the net charge of objects when the inducer is taken away
    - However, induction can redistribute the existing charges on the induced object
- Grounded Objects
    - Objects can be ground to the earth with a conducting wire
    - The earth is very large and can conduct, so it easily accepts/gives up electrons
    - Therefore, when an object is induced by another charged object, the original objects will become charged
    - If the wire is ever cut when the object is under induction, the charge will stay in the object

- .$\vec F \propto \text{angle of deflection}$
- .$y$-axis: .$F_{T1} \sin \theta_1 = F_{21}$
- .$x$-axis: .$F_{T1} \cos \theta_0 = m_1 g$
- .$F_{21} = m_1 g \tan \theta_1 \approx m_1 g \theta_1$
- .$F_{21} = - F_{12}$ ([Newton's Third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton's_third_law))
.$ \Longrightarrow \theta_1/\theta_2 = m_2/m_1$

# 21.5 Coulomb's Law

{{< hint info >}}
**Coulomb's Law:**
$$F = k \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$$
where .$k$ is a constant equal to .$8.988 \cdot 10^9 \text{ N m$^2$/C$^2$}$
{{< /hint >}}

- Very similar to [universal gravitation equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation)
    - However...
        1. .$F_C$ can repel, whereas .$F_G$ is always attractive
        2. .$F_C$ only acts on charged objects, whereas .$F_G$ acts on neutral objects too
    - .$F_G/F_C \approx 10^{-40} \Longrightarrow F_C \gg F_G$
- The coulomb (.$\text{C}$) is the SI unit for charge
- Properties of Coulomb Force:
    1. It can be attractive and repulsive
    2. It is not a contact force
    3. Inversely proportional to .$r^2$
    4. Proportional to amount of charge .$Q$ 
- The smallest charge we've observed is the elementary charge: .$e = 1.6022 \cdot 10^{-19} \text{ C}$
    - Electrons have a charge equal to .$-e$
    - Protons have a charge equal to .$+e = -Q_\text{electron}$
    - Charges are Quantized
        - That is, **all charges are multiples of** .$e$
        - Since electrons are elementary particles, by definition they can't be divided.
- .$k$ can also be written as .$\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}$
    - .$\varepsilon_0$ is called the [permittivity of free space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity) 
    - .$\varepsilon_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi k} = 8.85 \cdot 10^{-12} \text{C$^2$/N m$^2$}$


# 21.6 Electric Field

- Electric fields extend outward from every charge and permeates all of space 
    $$\overrightarrow E = \lim_{q\to0}\frac{\overrightarrow F}{q} \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow F = q \overrightarrow E$$
    - .$q$ is a positive charge
    - .$\overrightarrow F$ is the forces the field exserts on .$q$
    - Has units newtons per coulomb (.$\text{N/C}$)
- We can combine this with Coulomb's law to get
    $$\overrightarrow E = \frac{kqQ/r^2}{q} = k \frac{Q}{r^2}$$
    - We see that .$\overrightarrow E$ is independent of the non-source particle .$q$
    - .$Q$ is the particle that is responsible for the field in the first place 
- An electric field at a given point is the sum of all other electric fields that act on that point
    $$\overrightarrow E = \overrightarrow E_1 + \overrightarrow E_2 + ...$$
# 21.7 Electric Field Calculations for Continuous Charge Distributions

- We can extend our previous definition to calculus as
    $$\overrightarrow E = \int d \overrightarrow E = \int k\frac{1}{r^2}\ dq$$
    - .$dq = \lambda\ dl \text{ (line)} = \sigma\ dA \text{ (disk)} = \rho\ dV \text{ (sphere)}$
- When solving problems, it's a good idea to use symmetry, check charge direction, and (when applicable) use bounds of .$r \in [0, \infty]$
- We can write equation for an infinite plane holding a uniform surface charge density .$\sigma$
    $$2A \cdot \overrightarrow E = \frac{\sigma A}{\varepsilon_0} \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow E = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}$$
    - This also applies in the case where a charge is close to an infinite surface (so that the distance to the surface is much greater than the distance to the edges)
    - In the case where there are two oppositely charged sheets parallel to one another, the field is .$\vec E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}$ since there are two charges creating the field
- The case involving an infinitely long wire can be written generally as
    $$\overrightarrow E \cdot 2\pi RL = \frac{\lambda L}{\varepsilon_0} \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow E = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi\varepsilon_0 \cdot r}$$
    - .$r$ is the distance from a particle to the wire

# 21.8 Field Lines
{{< columns >}}
- To visualize electric fields, we draw **electric field lines** or **lines of force**
- Three properties of Electric Field Lines:
    1. Electric field lines **indicate the direction of the electric field**; the field points are in the direction tangent to the field line at any point -- see point .$P$ in .$\text{(a)}$
    2. The lines are drawn so that the magnitude of the electric field, .$E$, is proportional to the number of lines crossing unit area perpendicular to the lines (i.e. a circle 'hugging' a point charge). **The closer together the lines, the stronger the field.**
    3. Electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges; and **the number starting or ending is proportional to the magnitude of the charge**.
        - .$\text{Density} = \frac{\text{number of lines crossing surface}}{\text{area surface}}$
        - .$\text{1 Coulomb} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} \cdot \text{ lines}$
        - .$\therefore \text{Density} = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0 4\pi r^2} \Longrightarrow \vec E$
- In the case of two oppositely charged parallel & equally spaces plates -- such as case .$\text{(d)}$ -- we can write the field as
    $$\overrightarrow E=\text{const.} = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}=\frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0 A}$$
    - .$Q=\sigma A$ is the charge on one plate of area .$A$
- Field lines never cross because it wouldn't make sense for an electric field to have two directions at the same point.

![Dipole](/docs/physics-7b/imgs/dipole.png)
<--->

## Electric Dipole
- A combination of two equal but opposite charges next to one another -- see .$(\text{a})$ above
- [Dipole Moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_dipole_moment) is when represented by vector .$\vec{p}$ of magnitude .$Ql$
    - Molecules that have dipole moments are called **polar molecules**
- A dipole in a uniform electric field feels no net force, but does have a net torque (unless .$\vec p \parallel \vec E$)
- If .$\vec p \not \parallel \vec E$, .$W=\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \tau d\theta$ where .$\tau = -\vec p\vec E\sin\theta = \vec p \times \vec E$ 
    - Simplifies to .$W=\vec p\vec E(\cos\theta_2 - \cos\theta_1)$
    - Thus, work/torque is most at .$\theta = 90^\circ$ or .$180^\circ$ depending on .$\vec E$ direction
    - Pay attention to right hand rule when solving
- If .$r \gg l \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow E \propto 1/r^3$

# 21.9 Electric Fields and Conductors

- The static electric field inside a conductor is zero (in static situations where electrons have had time to stop moving)
    - For that reason, any net charge on a conductor distributes itself on the surface
    - Charges inside conductors act as if the conductor isn't there
- All the electric field lines just outside a charged conductor are perpendicular to the surface

# 21.10 Motion of Charged Particle

- Vector Form of Forces
    $$\overrightarrow F_{12} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \cdot \widehat r_{21}$$
    - Notation:
        - .$\overrightarrow F_{12}$ means force on .$q_1$  by  .$q_2$ since .$q_2$ is the source charge
        - .$\widehat r_{21} = - \widehat r_{12} \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow F_{12} = -\overrightarrow F_{21}$
    - Direction
        - If .$q_1 q_2 > 0$ (same sign, repulse), then the force and unitary vectors both point away from the two charges

![Same Signs 21](/docs/physics-7b/imgs/repel-21.png)
{{< /columns >}}
      - If .$q_1 q_2 < 0$ (opposite sign, attract), then the force vector points towards the two charges and the unitary direction vector still points away from the two charges

- Superposition Principle
    - In a system considering multiple (3+) charges, forces acting on .$q_1$ by .$q_2$ (.$F_{12}$) is independent from whether other charges are present
    - Total forces acting on .$Q_1$ can be written as .$\overrightarrow F = \overrightarrow F_{12} + \overrightarrow F_{13} + ...$
        - Remember to break down the vectors into .$x/y$ components when adding them 
            - E.x. .$(F_{1})_x = (F_{12})_x + (F_{13})_x + ...$
        - Realize that the axis are arbitrary 
    - .$\theta = \tan^{-1}\Big(\frac{F_x}{F_y}\Big)$
- Charges in Fields
    1. Charge moving with .$\vec v$ that is parallel to  uniform field .$\overrightarrow E$
        - .$\overrightarrow F = q \overrightarrow E = m \vec a \Longrightarrow a_x = \frac{q}{m}\overrightarrow E = \text{const.}$
        - .$\vec v = \sqrt{2a_x \vec d} = \sqrt{\frac{2q}{m}\overrightarrow E_x \vec d}$
    2. Charge moving with .$\vec v$ that is orthogonal to uniform field .$\overrightarrow E$
        - Similar to projectile in gravitational field: .$\vec g \sim \overrightarrow E$ 
        - .$\overrightarrow F_x = 0 \Longrightarrow v_{x2} = v_{x1};\ \ a_x = 0$
        - .$\overrightarrow F_y = q \overrightarrow E = m a_y;\ \ a_y = \vec a = \frac{q}{m}\overrightarrow E = \text{const.}$
        - .$y(t) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{q\overrightarrow E}{m}t^2$
