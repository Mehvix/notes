# 21.1 Static Electricity; Electric Charge and its Conservation

- "Charged" objects posses a net electric charge
- Unlike charges attract; like charges repel
    - Charges on glass are positive, charges on plastic is negative
- **Law of Conservation of Electric Charge**: Whenever a certain amount of charge is produced in one object, an equal amount of the opposite type of charge is produced in another object
    - E.x. a plastic ruler is rubbed with a paper towel. The plastic acquires a _negative_ charge and the towel obtains an equal _positive_ charge
    - In other words, the net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero

# 21.2 Electric Charge in the Atom

- Atoms are made up of positive nucleus surrounded by at least one negatively charged electron.
    - Inside the nucleus are protons which are positively charged and neutrons which have no charge
    - The charges of electrons and protons are equal in magnitude
- E.x. neutral atoms with no charge contain an equal number of protons and electrons
- When an atom gains a charge (by losing/gaining electrons), it then has a net charge and is called an **ion**
- **Neutral** objects have a net charge of zero
    - Over time, objects left alone with a charge tend to lose their charge
    - This is because over time, electrons are exchanged with water molecules in the air 
        - Water molecules are **polar**: They are neutral, their charges aren't equally distributed
    - Thus, on rainy days it's harder for an object to maintain a charge for too long

# 21.3 Insulators and Conductors

- **Conductor:** Material that allows charge to flow between objects
    - Metals tend to be good conductors
    - Electrons are relatively lose: can move freely within metal, but can't leave easily
        - Called *free* or *conduction* electrons
- **Insulator:** Opposite of conductors; don't easily allow a flow of charge
    - Most materials other than metals tend to be good insulators
        - Notably rubber and wood
    - Electrons are bound very tightly to the nuclei
    - Almost no free electrons
- **Semiconductors:** Somewhere between the two former
    - Silicon, germanium
    - Less free electrons than a conductor, but more than an insulator

# 21.4 Induced Charge; Electroscope

- **Conduction:** Charge transfer by physical contact 
    - E.x. a positively charged metal rod touches a neutral metal rod. Free electrons from the neutral rod will then flow to the charged rod, leaving the formerly neutral rod now slightly positively charged
- **Induction:** Charge distribution altered by bringing two objects close, but not touching
- Grounded Objects
    - Objects can be ground to the earth with a conducting wire
    - The earth is very large and can conduct, so it easily accepts/gives up electrons
    - Therefore, when an object is induced by another charged object, the original objects will become charged
    - If the wire is ever cut when the object is under induction, the charge will stay in the object

# 21.5 Coulomb's Law

{{< hint info >}}
**Coulomb's Law:**
$$F = k \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$$
where .$k$ is a constant equal to .$8.988 \cdot 10^9 \text{ N m$^2$/C$^2$}$
{{< /hint >}}

- Very similar to [universal gravitation equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation)
    - However, gravity is always attractive whereas charges can repel
- The coulomb (.$\text{C}$) is the SI unit for charge
- The smallest charge we've observed is the elementary charge: .$e = 1.6022 \cdot 10^{-19} \text{ C}$
    - Electrons have a charge equal to .$-e$
    - Protons have a charge equal to .$+e$
    - Ideally, all charges are multiples of .$e$
- .$k$ can also be written as .$\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}$
    - .$\varepsilon_0$ is called the [permittivity of free space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity) 
    - .$\varepsilon_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi k} = 8.85 \cdot 10^{-12} \text{C$^2$/N m$^2$}$
