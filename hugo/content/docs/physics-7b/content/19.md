# 19.1 Heat as Energy Transfer

## Units

- Heat unit is calorie (cal)
    - The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 celsius
    - $$4.186 \text{ J} = 1 \text{ cal}$$
- Kilocalorie (kcal, Calorie) is more common
    - Amount of heat needed to raise 1 kg of water by 1 celsius
    - $$4.186 \text{ kJ} = 1 \text{ kcal}$$
- British system of units has British thermal units (Btu)
    - One Btu is the heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 lb of water by 1 Fahrenheit
    - $$1 \text{ Btu} = 0.252 \text{ kcal} = 1056 \text{ J}$$
    - Gas companies use the unit therm: .$10^5 \text{ Btu}$

## Heat

- Heat is energy transferred from one object to another because of a difference in temperature.
    - Energy transfers from hot to cold object until equilibrium
- The SI units for heat is the joule:
    - This is because heat is a form of energy!

# 19.2 Internal Energy

- **Internal Energy**: The sum of all the energy of all the molecules in an object
    - Sometimes called thermal energy

## Difference between Temp, Heat, and Internal Energy

- Temperature is the **average** kinetic energy of all of the molecules
- Internal energy is the **sum** of the energy of all of the molecules
    - E.x. Two equal-mass iron ingots could the same temperature as a single ingot, but the two would have double the internal energy
- Heat refers to the **transfer** of energy from one object to another due to a difference in temperatures
    - Direction of transfer depends on temperature, **not** internal energy
    - E.x. .$50\text{ g}$ of .$30^\circ\text{ C}$ water mixed with .$200 \text{ g}$ of .$25^\circ \text{ C}$ water results with heat transferring from the smaller sample with less internal energy to the larger sample with more internal energy.

## Calculating Internal Energy

- Internal energy is the sum of all the **translational** kinetic energy of the molecules in a monatomic gas
    - **Monatomic**: Gas with one atom per molecule
- We can re-write this as the average KE per molecule times the total number of molecules, .$N$

$$E_{\text{int}} = N \bigg(\frac{1}{2}m\bar{v}^2\bigg) = \frac{3}{2}Nk_bT = \frac{3}{2}nRT$$

- We can see that internal energy for a monatomic gas depends only on the temperature and number of moles

- If a gas isn't monatomic, then we need to consider the rotational and vibrational energy of the molecules
    - **Non-monatomic** gasses result in a internal energy at a given temperature compared to a monatomic
- The internal energy of real gases depends mainly on temperature
    - There are some exceptions of gases depending on pressure and volume as well
- Internal energy of liquids and solids is more complex
    - It includes electric potential energy of the chemical bonds

# 19.3 Specific Heat

- Amount of heat required to change the temperature of a material is found with the following:
$$Q = mc \Delta T$$

- .$c$ [specific heat capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_heat_capacity) that depends on the material .$\[\text{J}/(\text{C}^\circ\text{ kg})\]$
- For water at .$15 ^\circ \text{ C}$ and constant pressure .$1 \text{atm}$, .$c = 4168 \text{ J}/(\text{C}^\circ\text{ kg}) = 1.00 \text{ kcal}/(\text{C}^\circ \text{ kg})$
    - .$c$ does vary to some extent with temperature (and slightly pressure), but for small .$\Delta T$ we can say .$c$ is a constant
- Relative to other materials/substances, water has a high specific heat capacity

# 19.4 Calorimetry

## Types of Systems

- **System**: Any (set of) object(s) we choose to consider
- **Closed System**: Mass is constant, but energy may be exchanged within environment
    - **Isolated**: If no energy in any form passes across its boundaries
    - We idealize systems to be closed systems, which is rare in the real world
    - Heat will flow from hot to cold region of system until equilibrium
    - We can assume that no energy is lost; heat lost in one part = heat gained in another part or .$\Sigma Q = 0$
- **Open System**: Mass and energy may enter/leave

## Calorimeter

- **Calorimetry**: Quantitative measure of heat exchange
- Calorimeter tend to have insulation so that no heat is exchanged with the surrounding air
- Often use thermometer to measure change the temperature
- E.x. a substance sample will be heated up, measured, then quickly placed inside cool water of calorimeter
    - The heat lost from the sample will be gained by the water and the calorimeter cup
    - Measuring final temperature of the mixture lets us calculate the specific heat
- Assume that small masses like the thermometer/stirrer are negligible

# 19.5 Latent Heat

- **Change of Phase**: When a material changes from solid to liquid or liquid to gas.
    - A certain energy is required for a phase change
    - Latent heat is lost during phase change (often in the form of heat)

![Phase Change from Ice to Gas](/docs/physics-7b/imgs/phase-changes.png)

- **Heat of fusion**, .$L_F\$: Heat required to change .$1.0 \text{ kg}$ of a substance from solid to liquid state
    - Heat fusion of water is .$79.7 \text{kcal/kg} = 333 \text{kJ/kg}$
- **Heat of Vaporization**, .$L_V\$: Heat required to change a substance from liquid to vapor phase
    - Heat vaporization is .$539 \text{kcal/kg} = 2260 \text{kJ/kg}$
- Heat involved in the phase change depends on the mass and latent heat:
    - $$Q = mL$$

## Evaporation

- Heat of Vaporization of water increases slightly with a decrease in Temperature
- At .$20^\circ \text{ C}$, it's .$585 \text{ \text{kcal/kg}}$
- When liquid evaporates, the remaining liquid cools because the heat/energy comes from the water itself
- Therefore, internal energy decreases with evaporation

## Kinetic Theory of Latent Heats

- At melting point, the latent heat of fusion **doesn't** increase the average KE / temperature
- Rather, the energy goes into overcoming the PE associated with the forces between the molecules
    - Once the molecules in a solid are broken from there lattice formation, they can freely roll over one another as a liquid
- More energy is required for liquid to gas phase because the average distance between the molecules is greatly increased
    - The larger the distance that the molecules have to be separated, the more work has to be done to pull them apart

# 19.6 First Law of Thermo

- Heat and work are different
    - Heat is the transfer of energy due to a difference in temperature
    - Work is the transfer of energy **not** due to a temperature difference
- Internal energy and temperature are both proportional to heat and work though with the following equation:
    $$\Delta E_{\text{int}} = Q - W = E_{\text{int, 2}} - E_{\text{int, 1}} \ \ \ \text{[First Law of Thermo.]}$$
- .$Q$ is net **heat added** to the system
    - Heat *added* is .$\texttt{+}$, heat *lost* is .$\texttt{-}$,
- .$W$ is net **work done by** the system
    - Work done *by* system is .$\texttt{+}$, work done *on* the system is .$\texttt{-}$,
- .$Q$ and .$W$ are **not state variables** in that a static state doesn't have "heat" or "work" -- only when the system changes through thermodynamic process can we measure heat/work.
    - This is unlike .$P, V, T$ and .$E_{\text{int}}$ which are **state variables** (can be measured at all states)
- We can also extend the first law to include systems that have KE and PE:
  $$\Delta K + \Delta U + \Delta E_{\text{int}} = Q - W = E_{\text{int, 2}} - E_{\text{int, 1}}$$

# 19.7 Thermodynamic Process and the 1st Law

## Isothermal Process (.$\Delta T = 0$)

![PV Diagram](/docs/physics-7b/imgs/isothermal.png)

- When temperature is constant, .$PV = \text{constant}$
- Each label of points in the graph above represent the systems states (it's pressure and temperatures)
- **Isotherms**: curves in PV diagram
    - At a lower temperature, an isothermal process would be represented by the isotherm .$A'B'$
- We also assume that the container is a **heat reservoir**: a body whose mass is so big that the temperature doesn't change when heat is exchanged
- 

## Adiabatic Process (.$\Delta T = 0$)
