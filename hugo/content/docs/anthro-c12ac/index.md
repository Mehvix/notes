# Anthropocene

- The time when human activity began to have an influence on (global) landscape due to our use of fire
- Large subject used in a range of fields -- no single definition
- Defining feature: combustion of carbon and greenhouse gases
- Ice core measurement technique
    - As ice forms, methane and .$CO_2$ get trapped along with ash/dust/pollen which scientists can measure
    - Ice can be dated so we can compare these variables so we can see change in greenhouse gases over time
- Beginning is disputed
    - Industrial revolution (1780s)
        - Most popular among scholars
    - Atomic Testing (1940s)
        - The isotopic by-products of bomb testing provide a distinctive marker horizon in ice cores, ocean and lake sediments, and soils
    - Stages idea:
        - Includes vital events such as forest cutting and grassland conversion: the two largest spatial transformations of Earth’s surface in human history
        1. 1.8 million years ago: When fire was discovered
        2. 6000-4000s years ago: With neolithic agriculture
        3. 1780s: Industrial revolution
- Identifying fire requirements:
    1. Evidence of temporal or spatial changes in fire activity and vegetation
    2. Demonstration that these changes are not predicted by climate parameters alone
    3. Temporal/spatial coincidence between fire regime changes and changes in the human record

# Pyrogeography

- History of the variation of fire activity over space and time at the landscape scale in different regions of the world
- Pyrogeography started in [Silurian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian) when plant life began
- Fire requirements: .$13 \\%\ O_2$ in a normal environment and .$30\%$ in damp vegetation.
- Fires are a selection force in the evolution of plants

# Four phases for Pyrogeography

## 1. Natural Biospheric Fire -- Natural Fire Regime

- (Potential) start date for pyrogeography
- During [Silurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian) and Devonian Periods (440-400 HYA)
- Natural fire regime started during this period because it was the first time that the fire triangle came together
- Fire triangle:
    - _Ignition Source_: (Since beginning) Natural ignition from lightening, volcanoes, (rarely) falling rock sparks
        - These natural sources tend to only begin fires in the dry season
    - _Oxygen Source_: (Cambrian period) Atmospheric Oxygen (from photosynthetic plants) leads to appearance of photosynthetic organisms
    - _Fuel Source_: (Silurian and Devonian Periods) Enough terrestrial plants in ecosystems to acts as fuel
- During this time, natural fire regimes evolved
    - As coal became more common (Carboniferous period), fires did too

## 2. Wildland Anthropogenic Fire -- Hunter/Gatherer Fire Regime

- When people began acting as the _ignition source_
- Primarily used fire for domestic cases
    - Heating, cooking, warmth, etc.
- When people move to a new land
    - Major changes in fauna, vegetation, and fires (charcoal)
    - People seem to bring fire with them as they migrate
- Start dates
    - 40 ka for Australia
        - 90% of fauna went extinct
        - Lots of evidence of fire
    - 45 ka for Highland New Guinea
    - 50 ka for lowland Borneo
    - 20 ka for the Americas
        - Extinctions of many animals and vegetation
            - Debate: are these because of natural process like climate change (ice age -> post ice age?) or do people play a large role
        - Native Perspective – Indigenous people have been here since time began

### When did humans actually discover fire?

- Defining the bridge between phase one and two is difficult
- Definition problems
    - Do we ask when did (modern humans / hominin ancestors) develop the ability to control and utilize fire?
    - We also need to distinguish between (1) controlling / utilizing fire and (2) being able to start a fire on a whim
- Archeological problems
    - Fire exists naturally, so we can't assume all fire evidence is from human action
    - Other natural processes can look like fire (e.g. staining by minerals in soil, oxidation causing reddish patches)
    - Combustion of natural objects (e.g. bushes) can leave charcoal which looks like a human hearth
        - Additionally, evidence of a hearth doesn't mean that humans started/controlled fire
- Archaeological Record Analysis
    - In the field:
        - Observation and collection of materials
        - Study the geology of the site
    - In the lab:
        - Microscopic analysis to see if there was burning
        - If so, could the location of the sample been transported after combustion?
        - Further, how does the history of the burned object associate with cultural items

### How long has fire been **controlled**?

- **Europe**: Strong evidence of 400,000 - 300,000 years ago
- **Western Asia**: One established case from 780,000 years ago. Other sites are similar to Europe
- **Africa**: Claims have been made for a cave site that shows fire around 1.5-1.6 million years ago
- Note that *opportunistic* use of fire could have happened much earlier
    - Eg. lighting a torch from a natural-starting forest fire


## 3. Agriculture Anthropogenic Fire -- Agricultural Fire Regime

- Required fire to alter the natural vegetation from perennial-dominated to annual-dominated landscapes.
- People preferred to live in fire-prone places because the burning provides advantages for hunting, foraging, cultivating, and livestock herding

## 4. Industrial and Domestic Anthropogenic Fire -- Industrial Fire Regime

- Low-severity surface fire regimes are being replaced with low-frequency, high-intensity crown fires that are outside the historical range of variability for these ecosystems
- _Western US_: forests have also experienced an increase in hazardous fuels due to highly effective fire suppression policy that excluded fires for much of the 20th century
- _Eastern US_: Fire suppression has shifted oak and pine woodlands to mesophytic hardwoods consequently reducing flammability and fire activity
- _Globally_: urban areas have steadily expanded into wildland areas
    - Producing more ignition sources (arson and accidental)
    - Exposing more people to wildfire

# Key Factors in Fire Regimes (Discussion 8-30)

1. **Frequency**
    - The interval of fire occurrences
    - E.x. every four years
2. **Area**
    - Size, distribution, location
    - Ground fires (primarily dead plants) vs crown (burning upper canopy of living trees)
        - Crown fires areas are more difficult to manage because controlled burns still damage natural resources
3. **Severity**
    - How destructive a fire is
    - Change in dominant species / change in ecosystem
    - Quantifiable by how much soil on the ground is visible
4. **Seasonality**
    - How the season affects fires
    - May or may not be annual
    - May arise due to weather conditions
    - Ex. Annual to decadal cycles of drying conditions
5. **Interactions**
    - General activity on the landscape leading to different fire outcomes
    - Droughts leading to stress on fuels
    - Beatles eating bark, making trees more vulnerable
    - Fire suppression leading to less severe fires
    - Climate change making fires more severe

# Biodiversity and Fire as a Selective Variable in Evolution

- .$C_4$ grass
    - Spread during seasonal climate in the tertiary period (when fires became more common)
    - Fires lead to woodlands and created environments favorable to .$C_4$ grasslands
    - Since .$C_4$ is high flammability, it would have produced a feedback process that further increased fire activity,
        - Thus maintaining the grassland-dominated landscape
        - This process is similar to the one currently maintaining many of our savannas
- Plant attributes
    - Heat shock
        - Certain species have seeds that will open with heat
        - Not exclusive to fire; correlated with soil heat too
    - Smoke
        - Highly selective and specific to fire
        - Smoke is a mixture of specific chemicals unique to itself
    - Note that plants become resistant to certain fire regimes, not necessarily all
        - Changes in fire regime can kill off fire resistant plants
- Even small differences in the deployment of fire outside of natural lightning strikes can alter patterns of forest  succession, fuel availability, and seasonality of ignitions

# Fires Relating to Evolution

- Beneficial Attributes
    - Cooking hypothesis
        - Key claim: Fire + cooking started with the Homo erectus. As such, humans have evolved around a cooked diet that they can't live without
        - Led to fitness advantage
        - More energy + nutrient from food, enabling body and brain size increase
        - Detoxing effect
        - Increase digestibility of all food
        - Cooking takes time, leading to social development
            - Distribution of tasks among group: (collection, preparation, even stealing)
        - Cooking accounts for reduction in jaw, tooth size (due to softer food), stomach, and digestive system size
        - There is no evidence of modern human societies existing without cooked food
        - Counterpoints:
            - It's still unclear that Homo erectus controlled fire
            - There are some sites that show no example of cooking: e.g. Neanderthal sites in cold climates
            - Energetic effects aren't well quantified
            - Digestive evolution may not have been linear; other adaptations related to fire occurred after Homo erectus
    - Protection benefits at night (especially versus the alternative: sleeping in trees)
    - Allowed much better vision in caves
        - Enables cave art
    - Evidence that some hominids could use fire to morph certain woods into tools (e.g. digging sticks, hafted spears)
    - Allowed humans to colonize colder environments
    - Increase prey abundances, maintain mosaic landscapes, and increase pyrodiversity and succession stage heterogeneity
- Social bonding
    - Led to camp fires
    - Allows people to stay up later
    - Fire could be used as a story telling enhancer, means to pass on history, culture, etc.
    - Provides a sense of intimacy and openness
    - Opportunity for music
- [Fire-stick farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-stick_farming)
    - clearing ground for human habitats
    - facilitating travel
    - killing vermin, hunting
    - regenerating plant food sources for both humans and livestock
    - warfare among tribes
- Woody, closed-canopy shrublands were opened up or entirely displaced
    - Led to spread of fast-growing annual species that provided greater seed resources, travel, and hunting and planting opportunities
    - Ex. CA land was only used for agriculture after burnings, which led to many other alien plants spreading too
    - Reductions in arboreal cover and woody understory have the most potential to enhance erosion
    - Reshaping of landscapes has posed problems for ecologists trying to understand contemporary landscape patterns

# Overview of Fires in California

[Conflagrating California](https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1806806/pdf)

- ~54% of CA ecosystems depend on fire
- The remaining ecosystems that aren't too extreme for fires (so not deserts, stony summits, wetlands, etc.) are fire adapted
    > _"Fire season is 13 months"_
- CA has a diverse ecosystem; each site is similar to another one elsewhere though
- What sets CA apart is the scale and intensity of it's fires

---

- CA's fires are unique in that they lead national discourse
- Texas views the US as France views the EUnion -- a canvas to project it's ideals
- Alaska view the US as a source of subsidies. It's isolated and treated almost as a commonwealth.
- California shares sizes, political isolation, and sense of selfhood with the aforementioned.
    - Unlike AL, it has a strong and wide economy
    - Unlike TX, it has been independent but not secessionist and, while CA and TX both have strong cultures, CA doesn't project its
- Importance - 1/9 Americans live in CA - 8th largest economy - Social uses 1/2 the national fire budget - Source (and testing ground) of new firefighting technology
    > _"CA is like the rest of the US, just more so"_

---

- Two CA
    - North and south
    - Sierra and Seacoast
    - Rich and poor
    - Scrubland, megalopolis, & wilderness
    - Lowest and highest elevation in nation (Mount Whitney @ 14,500 ft and Death Valley @ -280 ft)
- Sierra Nevada is analogous to NoCal
    - Big tilt
    - Highest in SE and slants lower to N + W
    - Mostly timber
    - More frequent fires
- Transverse Range is analogous to SoCal
    - Big Kink
    - Highest in E, bends sharp W then trails to pacific and N
    - Mostly bush
    - More intense fires
    - 56% of ppl live on 8% of land

---

- CA is a national innovator
    - Created geological survey in 1860
    - Created Board of Forestry in 1885
    - Set standard for fire control
- Light-burning controversy
    - Pro-burn:
        - Frontier practices (the Indian way of forest management)
        - Advocated for regular burning montane woods and lowlands
        - NoCal
    - Pro-protection
        - Use govt to prevent\fight fires
        - SoCal
    - National issue debated in CA
    - 1923: Light-burning anathematized

---

- Leopold report, Wilderness Act, and Tall Timbers fire ecology conferences
    - Began in 1962
    - Aimed to transform fire control into fire management
    - Good for conservation + private land owners who wanted traditional working landscapes
    - Loggers and ranchers started moving out at this time
    - Didn't target urban areas
- Urban Areas
    - Used fire suppression
        > CA to spawn as AK to wilderness
    - Fires in SoCal rained embers onto cities
    - SoCal retaliated w larger firefighting force
- New Practices
    - Operation Firestop: Transform tech into operational programs
    - _1956_: Aerial tankers used to drop retardant on firelines
    - _1961_: Specialty fire crews expanded nationally
    - _1963_: Forest Service opened Western Fire Lab to coordinate fire suppression w air attacks
    - _1970_: Organized SoCal fire agencies towards common practices
- Area Specialty
    - Florida: Prescribed fire
    - N Rockies: Management over back countries
    - (So)Cal: Fire suppression
        - Land management in Cali was synonymous to fire management, thus fire suppression

---

- As CA grew, the motivation for fire suppression was primarily economical
- This lead to divisive debates of suppression vs let-burn
    - When there were flames, it was fight or flight
- Many fire ideas spread from CA
    - Often transformed and simplified

---

- Fires are especially susceptible due to **Scioecological Systems (*SES*)**
    1. History of fires suppression
    2. Climate change
    3. More extreme fire weather
    4. Expanding development
    5. Droughts
- Difficult to predict future fire regimes well
- Changes in human behavior can amplify, but tend to _cancel out climatic effects_ on fire regimes
    - For example, humans alter through changing land use, ignitions, fuel conditions, or fire suppression
    - Fire **activity** is influenced by climate variability
        - More (less) fire occurred in dry (wet) and warm (cool) years, and high-fire years were preceded by moist and sometimes cool conditions 1–4 y earlier.
    - (Sierra Nevada) **fire-regime shifts** correlate to **SES changes**, _not shifts in climate_.
- Are best bet is to look at history and see how fire regimes changed from past changes in socioeconomic variables
    - Climate increased fire activity on a large-scale **after Native American depopulation** reduced the buffering effect of due to their burnings
        - Sierra Nevada tribes were hunter-gatherers who used sophisticated burning practices to manage resources
        - The fire index nearly doubled after depopulation 
    - Later Euro-American settlement and fire suppression buffered fire activity from temperature increases
        - Logging, fire suppression, livestock increase (grazing effects)
- The overall sensitivity of fire regimes to low-frequency temperature variation is related to temperature-driven vegetation changes that alter fuel structure and fuel type



# Peopling of North America

- Traditional Perspective – Clovis First Model
    - 13,000 ka, there was an ice-free corridor that opened up and let people come to north America
        - People from Asia follow herds of megafauna across Bering Strait ([Beringia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia))
    - We have found kill sites across America
        - Butchered mammoth, horses, bison, ground sloths, etc.
- New Thoughts about Peopling of Americas: Multiple Migrations of People 20,000-40,000 years ago
- Coastal Migration Model:
    - Use Boats to Come to Americas from Asia
    - Some travels may not have been successful which is why there is less evidence for this theory
    - Based on:
        1. Evidence sophisticated cultures
            - Art, pottery, (primitive) technology, etc.
        2. Evidence of maritime seafaring at early date (Australia, New Guinea, Japan)
        3. People follow the Kelp Highway Maritime
           - Kelp forests very productive (food source)
           - Kelp Highway went along Pacific Rim

# Peopling of California

- Earliest well dated sites in CA (13,000-10,000 BP) [Based on radio carbon dates]
    - Sites located in SoCal: Channel Islands, South Coast
    - These Islands have always been separated by water so we know people had boats relatively early
- Find Evidence of Shell Middens

    - Contain shell, fish, other maritime foods
    - Have evidence of **tools for kelp** + technology
    - Big Game Kill Sites rare in California Dietary Differences (Midwest/Plains vs California)
        - Perhaps because of dietary differences
        - Suggests different groups of people, so potentially different groups of migrants

- Major Changes observed on Channel Islands
    - Changes in Fauna (Pygmy Mammoths)
    - Changes in Flora
    - Evidence of Fires!
- Debate about what caused these changes
    - Due to...
        - Climate Change
            - Climate change at end of Ice Age
                - Mega herbivores died after ice age, increasing fuel sources (vegetation) which we can see with charcoal signatures
            - Causes warming + drying (leading to fire)
            - Changes in vegetation and animals because they couldn't adapt
        - Comet
            - Newest theory
            - Estimated that 5km comet hit earth somewhere
            - We've found comet-diamonds and various sites that have chemical signatures potentially from a comet
            - Cloud from comet would have affected photo-synthetic processes, killing plants + animals
        - People
            - People may have over-hunted animals
            - May have brought fire with them
    - Potentially due to multiple reasons
    - Kent thinks it's likely climate _change_ + _people_
- Concluding Points
    - Clearly people knew about fire from earliest times
    - Very Sophisticated Maritime Peoples
    - (Kent’s opinion) Early for early anthropogenic
    - Influenced fire regimes from earliest times
    - Implications: the Holocene Epoch in CA
    - (last 10,000 years); you cannot assume
    - That only Natural Fire Regimes existed
    - Must consider the influence of people

# Historical Fire Records in California

## Methods

- **Key Question:** What *methods* can we use to get historical information on fires?

### 1. Coring Lakes

![Lake Coring](/docs/anthro-c12ac/imgs/lake-core.png)
- Annual layers are laid down in some lakes
    - Realistically you can date to around fifty years of accuracy
    - This samples have deeper temporal depth vs other methods
    -  We can also radiocarbon date these samples to determine the time period
- What to sample
    - Charcoal present is indicates fire 
        - Larger particle tend to travel small distances
        - Smaller particles can travel much longer distances
    - Pollen analysis can give you knowledge on what (wind pollinated) plants were common at the time in that area
    - Phytoliths
        - Tiny particles formed in many plants
        - They don't break down -- can stay in soil for hundreds to thousands of years!
        - Can be used to identify plant species

### 2. Coring Trees 

![Tree Coring](/docs/anthro-c12ac/imgs/tree-core.png)

- You basically jab a metal straw into a tree and get a sample of the tree 
    - Doesn't harm tree, tree naturally patches the hole itself
- These sample contain rings 
- Give us age and growth rate of the tree
    - Growth increase in rings can allude to neighboring trees being killed
    - Dead neighboring trees means less canopy blocking sunshine and less trees competing for nutrients
- Multiple samples can give us an overview of a landscape
    - Do we see a multi-age forest?
    - Do we see synchrony in growth rate?
- **Crossdating**: To identify events, we compare the sample's tree rings to those of other "regular" trees in different areas at the same time
 
![Ring Example](/docs/anthro-c12ac/imgs/tree-ring.png)
- Note that the example above is a rare occurrence 


### 3. Fire Scars

![Scar Example](/docs/anthro-c12ac/imgs/fire-scar.png)

- Fire scars occur when fire kills part of the cambium below bark, leaving a wound 
- Multiple dated wounds allude to multiple fire occurrences
- You can also get the seasonality too
    - Spring trees have warmer water so the scars are lighter in color
    - Fall/winter trees have slower cell movement, so the scars are darker (this is called "latewood")
    - Therefore, how deep the scar is in the wood corresponds to the season the fire occurred 
- Use crossdating for high accuracy and precision 
- Wedges:
    - You can take wedges from the tree to get access to the ring view
    - Both living and dead wood samples can be dated
    - Pines, redwood, cedar, giant sequoia are all rot resistant thus good species to sample
    - You ideally want to cut a thin wedge that has a large surface area and includes center of tree
- Trees heal covering up scars or scars are in an exposed cavity that can be seen
- Problem when fire interval < 10 years
    - Most of the time fires aren't severe enough to scare deeply enough 
    - Only 5% of trees sampled scarred in Sierra Nevada

## Fire History Study Sierra Nevada 

- Two large sampling areas, one north and south Sierra Nevada
- Systematic fire history sample in mixed conifer forests
- Important confluence of at least 3 Tribes: Sierra Miwok, Yokut, and Western Mono. 
    - Burned extensively for multiple objectives
    - This periodic burning limited severity of fires
- Fire area did not exceed 1500 ha in any year. 
    - Approximately 50% of area
    - This is **tiny** compared to the scale of other fires in California!

## Area burned in California
- Before 1800
    - Lightning fire
    - Indian burning
        - Burned most of grasslands, wetlands, oak woodlands, some forests
    - 4.5 million acres/yr. burned 


## Costal California Today

- Large area: scotia to Morro bay
- Very diverse vegetation type 
    - From mixed conifer to costal prairie
    - Fire regimes depend on vegetation, thus they're diverse
    - Likewise, some regions don't consider burning at all and only do suppression whereas others use burnings frequently
- General ignition sources
    - At higher mountains, lighting  ignition occurs (still rare, however)
    - At lower elevations / costal areas, human ignition is the main sources
        - Looking at history, we see that Indian fires dominated for thousands of years 
- Sudden oak death (SOD) in Tanoak Forest
    - Invasive pathogen in Marin Country
    - Dead trees increase the severity of fires
- Prescribed fire periods
    - Done in fall if not drying to damage trees 
        - Trees are in dormant phase, less damaging
    - Done in spring if trying to control/limit
        - Wet spring conditions are easier to manage


### Location Types

    - Severity: Moderate
    - Interval: Low to moderate
    - Size: Moderate
    - Changed from fire exclusion, harvesting, and fire suppression


## Native Californians
- Long-History of Human Occupation in CA
    - Archaeological Evidence: 13,000 years or more 
    - Evidence for multiple immigrations from both sea and land to California
- Native communities are still in California
    - 110+ recognized tribes today in CA
    - We can learn from them now about how they treated fire over history
    - 80-100 languages spoken between all tribes
        - Evidence for multiple immigration waves
    - The concentration of native communities is most dense North of Mexico
- Packed Landscapes: 
    - Many Tribes (Tribelets) or Small Nations
    - 100-1000 people make up polities
    - Mostly small Tribal territories
    - Crowded Landscapes
- Complex Societies
    - Village Communities have Elaborate Ritual and Political Organizations
        - Different people would specialize in different areas
    - Food Storage (Granaries)
    - Sophisticated Material Culture: Baskets, Shell Beads, etc.
- Non-Agrarian People
    - No formal agriculture practices outside SE CA
    - Sustainer primarily by hunting/gathering (use of wild plants and gatherers)
    - Adjacent Areas – neighboring people would grow corn, beans, squash but Indians chose not to practice agriculture
    - Perception about Non-Agrarian people Changed over time
        - (Falsely) Seen initially as passive foragers that minimal impact to environment
- Indigenous Stewards of Land and Sea
    - Better way of describing CA Indians (compared to hunter gatherers)
    - Indians worked/work as **Active Agents to Augment Environmental Productivity and Diversity**
	- **Seascape Stewardship**:  Various ways Native people enhanced the productivity and sustainability of shellfish populations and fisheries
    - **Landscape Stewardship**:
    	- Anthropological Rethinking back to 1940s, picks up steam in 1970s, 1980s that culminates with Anderson 2005 publication
    	- Various Methods Employed in Landscape Management Practices:
        	- Transplanting Water Diversion
        	- Pruning/Coppicing
        	- Weeding/Tillage Sowing/Broadcasting Seeds
        	- All for the purpose of enhancing productivity of natural plants/animals
      	- **Most Important**: Anthropogenic or Cultural Burning was the key method of stewardship
          	- Long History in California (Channel Islands)?
          	- Mediterranean Climate is Fire Enabler
              	- Wet cool winters lead to high plant production
              	- Dry and drought-ful summers provide a dry, extensive fuel base
          	- Native Californians realized that fire was a natural occurrence and learned to live with fire
          	- Reasoning for Cultural Burnings (Landscape scale)
            	1. Fires Control Insects/Pests 
            	2. Remove Detritus, clean-up landscape 
            	3. Open Pathways
            	4. Use Fire to Hunt Game (driving animals into traps/valleys) and Insects
            	5. Produce Straight Stems for cordage, baskets
            	6. Augment Growth/Diversity of Plants and Animals in Territory
            	7. Increases productivity of nutrient rich plants that animals eat 
                  	- Deer heard sizes are correlated with burnings 
            - How Areas Were Burned
                - Instigate fire regimes with frequent, small, low-intensity surface burns
                    - Seasonality of burning very important to minimize risk of catastrophic fires
                    - Additionally, risk reduced by reduce fuel loads + creating fuel breaks
                - Burn to increase productivity and stimulate growth of broad spectrum of economic resources
                    - Notably shrubs with berries, oak woodlands, coniferous 
                - Intentionally create Patchy Mosaics
                    - Different environments benefit from different style burnings resulting in checkerboard-esque patterns
                    - Increase quantity, diversity and sustainability of key plants and animals
                    - Used for foods, medicines, and raw materials
                    - Minimize risk of catastrophic fires due to reduced fuel loads and fire breaks
                - Burn areas contained by natural rivers/hills/ridges/basalt flows
            - Implications of Cultural Burning
                - Not Pristine Wilderness, but Managed Anthropogenic Landscape -- you have to take into account Indians when looking at CA's landscape
                - You can't do restoration without bringing in people 
                    - Now, because of a lack of recent cultural burnings, some habitats are struggling 
- Controversy regarding cultural burnings
    - Some argue that cultural fires were small in size, near villages, and had little impact on the larger ecosystem
    - Rather, natural fires best explain these fires
    - Short Temporal Depth for cultural burnings
        - Observations limited primarily to last 250 years 
    - Limitations arise when primarily referring to Tribal Oral Traditions, Ethnohistoric Observations, Ethnographic Studies
        - Accounts tend to be spotty, geographically biased and not very detailed
- Ethnographic Studies (observations made by trained anthropologists)
    - Fire Exclusion – by Spanish in 1793
    - Fire Suppression – picks up in 1890s and early 1900s
    - Implication:  Ethnography done after 1901
    - Post-dates time that Native people were able to legally implement Cultural Burning
        - Native people arrested, jailed for cultural burning
