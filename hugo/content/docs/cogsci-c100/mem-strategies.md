# Memory strategies

## Deep processing/meaning

- **Meaning/deep processing**: processing information deeply (by its meaning) produces better recall at a later time than does shallow processing (attending to its appearance or sound)
	* _Mere repetition is not very effective in enhancing long-term memory, but understanding aids memory_
	- To enhance recall, use **elaboration**: relate new information to other information in memory

## Organization

- **Organization**: effective organization of material greatly enhances recall
	- **Chunking:** organizing items into familiar, manageable units
    	- Chunking lists of numbers, letters, or names can enhance memory

	- **Hierarchical organization**: clustering chunks as a hierarchy
		- Material organized in a hierarchical structure is recalled significantly better than disorganized material
        - Organization of material during studying aids later recall

- **First-letter technique**: using the first letter of each word in a series to make up a phrase (acronyms)
    - Roy G. Biv
	- HOMES
	- Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally
	- King Henry Died Monday Drinking Chocolate Milk
	- SOH-CAH-TOA
	- Mother Very Earnestly Made Jelly Sandwiches Using No Peanuts
	- King Peter Came Over From Germany Seeking Fortune
	- Fat Cats Get Drunk After Eating Beans
	- SACRED MANOR
	- The knuckle trick for the number of days in each month

## Imagery

- Recall is best when information is encoded both visually and semantically
	- **Key word method**

### Method of loci

- **Method of loci** technique or _mnemonic_ (memory technique)

### Rhymes and songs

- Homer’s Odyssey was transmitted by storytellers who relied solely on their memories
	* The use of rhyme, rhythm, and repetition helped the storytellers remember
- Even the simple addition of a familiar rhythm or melody can help students remember information
    - Many children learn the letters of the alphabet to the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"
    - I before E except after C
    - And when saying "A" as in Neighbor or Weigh. (And weird is weird.)
    - Spring ahead; Fall back
    - Those at the top of the cave must "hold on ‘tite’ lest they fall down" to distinguish between stalagmites and stalactites

### Imagery and prospective memory

* Use of imagery in enhancing **prospective memory**
    - Study on 60- to 81-year-old adults who needed to remember to test their blood sugar
    	- **Imagination condition**: pictured themselves taking blood sugar during activity they routinely engaged in, e.g., right after drinking morning orange juice
  		- **Rehearsal condition**: repeatedly reciting instructions out loud
    	- **Deliberation condition**: writing down pros and cons for taking blood sugar
    		* **Results**: participants remembered 76% of time in imagination condition vs. 46% in other conditions (Liu & Park, 2004)
    * Use of physical retrieval cues can also be effective for enhancing prospective memory, e.g., leaving pen in middle of desk or tying yarn around finger (Rogers & Milkman, 2016)

## Review

- **Review**: putting information into your own words and testing yourself to determine what you do not know is much more effective than passively reading over material
	- Even more effective if you wait at least ten minutes after reading a selection before quizzing yourself
    	* Talking to people about what you know and testing yourself (generation effect) is one of the most effective memory strategies!
	- Taking lecture notes by hand, which requires summarizing material in your own words, leads to better retention than does verbatim laptop note taking (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014)
        > "The pen is mightier than the keyboard"

## Spacing effect

- **Spacing effect**: information is retained better when study sessions are distributed over time rather than massed
	- Study compared students who learned 50 Spanish words
    	- in lessons spread one day apart
        - in lessons separated by 30 days
	* When tested eight years later, the students who had distributed their practice recalled almost twice as much (Bahrick & Phelphs, 1987)

## Practice effect

- **Practice effect**: the more time that is spent studying material, the more likely one is to remember it
	* Overlearning aids recall
    - Ericsson’s studies of expert performers in diverse fields (music, math, science, chess, and sports) found that in every case, outstanding performers shared certain characteristics
	- **10,000-hour rule**: virtually all experts had spent over 10,000 hours in deliberate practice (usually 10+ years for at least 4 hours every day)
	- They were taught by outstanding teachers
    	- Mozart started practicing the violin at the age of three, his father was an outstanding violin teacher, and he practiced on average 10 hours a day
    - A large number of studies have found a direct correlation between number of hours of practice and level of expertise in elite musicians, chess players, etc.

## Context effect

- **Context effect** (encoding specificity effect or statedependent memory): recall is better where there is high degree of similarity between test environment and encoding environment
{{< columns >}}<!-- mathjax fix -->
- People who learned lists of words underwater showed better recall when tested under water; those who learned on land showed better recall when tested on beach (Godden & Baddeley, 1975)
- Students who learned words in room that smelled of chocolate, cinnamon-apple, or mothballs performed better on recall test if same smell was again present (Schab, 1990) 
- Participants who were drunk when learning a word list performed better on recall test when they were again drunk (Weingartner, Adefris, Eich et al., 1976)

## Self-reference effect

> _Me! Me! Me!_

- **Self-reference effect**: memory is enhanced by relating stimuli to one’s own personal experience
	- In advertising, people are more likely to recall the brand name of a product if they had been asked to imagine themselves using the product than if they had been given information about the product (Klein & Kihlstrom, 1986)
	- Asians exhibit greater self-referencing of Asian models, and this results in more favorable attitudes toward the ad and greater purchase intention (Martin, Lee, & Yang, 2004)

### Emotional arousal

- **Emotional arousal**: arousal enhances learning and retention of memories
	- Arousal sears events into the brain
    	- People given a drug that blocks the effects of stress hormones will later have more trouble remembering the details of an upsetting story
	- However excessive stress may corrode neural connections (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder)

## Sleep

- **Sleep**, especially REM sleep, is important for memory consolidation

## Timing factor

- **Timing factor**: material presented an hour before sleep tends to be remembered best
	* Even 10 minutes of waking rest enhances memory of what we have read (Dewar, Alber, Butler et al., 2012)

## Multimodal approach

- **Multimodal approach**: paying attention to your mental and physical condition, as well as flexible use of memory strategies

## Belief

- **Belief**: anything that you believe will boost your memory will boost your memory!
    * Researchers were able to use subliminal messages representing either senile behavior (e.g., "absent-minded," "senile") or "wise" behaviors (e.g., "sees all sides of issues," "smart" to manipulate performance of seniors on memory tests (Levy & Langer, 1994)
	* Issue of whether all memories are potentially retrievable is impossible to prove, but it’s probably advantageous to believe that they are

# Other Factors Affecting Memory

## Schemas

- **Schemas**: generalized mental representation or concept of a given class of objects, scenes, or events that can aid (or distort!) recall

## Mood-congruence effect

- **Mood-congruence effect**: tendency to recall experiences that are consistent with one’s current good or bad mood
	- Depressed people are likely to recall more negative experiences than positive experiences
	- Currently depressed people recall their parents as rejecting, punitive, and guilt-promoting, whereas formerly depressed people describe their parents much as do those who have never suffered depression
    * In the long run, people tend to recall pleasant events better than unpleasant ones
    * In the short run, we tend to experience a negativity bias

## Mood effect

- **Mood effect**: people score more poorly on memory tests when they are depressed
  
## Introversion/extraversion factor

- **Introversion/extraversion factor**: introverts are more easily distracted by outside noise/music during encoding than extraverts

# Factors Affecting Neurogenesis

![](/docs/cogsci-c100/mem-strategies/factors.png)

- Learning
	- An enriched environment
	- Exposure to estrogen
	- Physical exercise
- Studies involving mice, as well as people, show strong relationships between being physically active or fit and having greater brain volume and stronger cognitive abilities -- even when participants are young and healthy
	- Recent research on mice indicates that the neurocognitive benefits of exercise derive in large from irisin
		- Irisin is a hormone produced during endurance exercise that improves cognitive function, dampens neuroinflammation, ensures the healthy development of new neurons, and reduces risk of development of Alzheimer’s
- Exercise, Neurogenesis, and Learning & Memory

## Physical exercise

- Muscle fiber contains a scaffold made of special proteins that hold these acetylcholine receptors in place
- Rats that ran on a treadmill show increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is known to support the health of existing neurons and coax the creation of new brain cells (Cassihas, Lee, Fernandes et al, 2012)
- As little as 3 hours a week of aerobic exercise (brisk walking) triggers biochemical changes that increase production of new neurons; stretchers-and-toners do not show similar brain changes (Colcombe, Erickson, Paige et al, 2006)
- Children who walked briskly or jogged on a treadmill for 20 min showed marked improvement in math and reading comprehension scores; those who read quietly for 20 min did not (Pontifex, Saliba, Laine et al, 2013)
- Older women who walked or did weight training for 6 months performed significantly better on tests of spatial and verbal memory (Nagamatsu, Chan, Davis et al, 2013)
- Sedentary behavior is associated with reduced thickness of medial temporal lobe, which contains hippocampus (Siddarth, Burggren, Eyre et al, 2018)

- Rats in experimental and control groups were then placed in brightly lit maze with single, darkened chamber
	- Rats gravitate toward dark places, so animals were expected to learn the location of the chamber and aim for it
    	- Bags of weighted pellets were gently taped to the rats’ rear ends
    	- They were rewarded with a Froot Loop when they reached the top of a 3-foot ladder (Kelty, Schachtman, Mao et al., 2019)
	- Rats in experimental group were injected with substance known to induce inflammation and cognitive impairments, then given weight training
        - Research on rats indicate that exercise can even compensate for neurocognitive impairments
	* Results:
		- In first few tests, control animals were fastest and most accurate
		- With a little practice though, the weight-trained animals, despite their induced cognitive impairments, caught up to and in some cases surpassed the speed and accuracy of the controls
		- Moreover, researchers found that the memory centers of the weight trainers now teemed with enzymes and genetic markers known to help kick-start the creation and survival of new neurons

## Factors that inhibit neurogenesis

- **Stress** and **glucocorticoids** -- as little as a few hours of either in a rat!
- Food additives?

# Nootropics: Drugs that may enhance memory

- **Caffeine**: anything that increases attention will tend to boost learning and memory
- **Gingko biloba**: may enhance memory in Alzheimer’s patients
- **Experimental drugs**
	- Drugs that boost production of CREB (e.g., phosphodiesterase inhibitors), which turns on genes that code for production of proteins important in formation of new synapses
        - Drawback: can produce really nasty side effects, such as severe nausea
	- Drugs that increase levels of glutamate, a neurotransmitter that enhances LTP
        - Drawback:: may increase risk of seizures and strokes
  	* At this point, it’s probably much more effective just to get more sleep!
