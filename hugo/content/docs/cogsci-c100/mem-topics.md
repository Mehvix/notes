# Neurological Mind Reading

Team of neuroscientists at Carnegie Mellon led by Marcel Just are learning to read people’s minds based on fMRI cortical activation patterns

- In early study, researchers were able to identify which of 10 similar objects (e.g., hammer vs. drill vs. screwdriver) people were viewing based on scans (Shinkareva, Mason, Malave et al., 2008)
- Lab has now also identified activation patterns associated with (Wang, Cherkassky, & Just, 2017)
    - Different abstract ideas (e.g., forgiveness vs. gossip vs. spirituality)
    - Thinking in different languages
    - Different emotions

- Participant is asked to think of scenario that would conjure up disgust, envy, etc. (e.g., someone vomiting at baseball game, beautiful model)
* Computer is able to identify the emotion

- fMRI cortical activation patterns can now also be used to distinguish between participants with autism and controls with 97% accuracy (Just, Cherkassky, Buchweitz et al., 2014)
	* When those with autism were asked to think of social interactions like adore, hug, humiliate, they showed significantly less activation in areas associated with the self than controls
		- Thought of words more like definitions, rather than experiences
- Patients with suicidal ideation were asked to think about death related words (e.g., funeral, death) and positive words (e.g., praise, good, carefree)
	* Compared with non-suicidal controls, self-related brain regions showed significantly more activation for death-related words and less activation for positive words (Just, Pan, Cherkassky et al., 2017)

# The Online Brain: Effects of the Internet on Cognition

- 45% of US teens report that they are online "almost constantly" (Pew Research Center, 2018)
- According to review article published in World Psychiatry, research suggests that this increase in Internet use may be... (Firth, Torous, Stubbs et al., 2019)
	- Impairing our ability to sustain attention
	- Negatively impacting our memory and analytical thinking ability
	- Promoting a type of social comparison that increases risk of depression and mental health problems, especially among adolescents
    	- Due to constant social comparison

## Attention and impulse control

- Studies have shown that adopting a less physically and cognitively active lifestyle across the lifespan may accelerate loss of cognitive function
    - Similar to Alzheimer's prevention
- Emerging evidence indicates that disengaging from the "real world" in favor of virtual settings may similarly induce adverse neurocognitive changes
	- Ex: Adult participants (both gamers and non-gamers) engaged in an online role playing game daily for 6 weeks (55 hours total on average)
	* Showed significant reductions in gray matter within the **orbitofrontal cortex** relative to matched controls (Zhou, Montag, Sariyska et al., 2019)
		- The OFC is a brain region important in executive function, impulse control, and decision making
- In addition, leading technology companies have been accused of intentionally capitalizing on the addictive potential of the Internet without concern for user well-being
	- They study, test, and refine attention-grabbing aspects of their websites and apps to promote extremely high levels of use
---

- **Tech companies** try to maximize the amount of time you spend on your phone/computer because that is how they make their money
	- You don’t pay for Facebook; ads do
	- The more time you spend on Facebook, the more money they make from ads 
    	- Ad spending on social media has reached 40 billion dollars a year
- So... computer scientists study huge data sets extensively to figure out how to get you to spend more time online
	- Example:
		- Holding some "likes" back for you to give you big burst later at exactly the right moment (based on complex algorithmic analyses) to effect "improvement in behavior" 
		- Similar to gambling -- you never know which roll (picking up the phone) will result in a rush, so you do it often
- The typical person checks their phone every 15 minutes, and half the time there is no sort of alert... because checking the phone results in
	- **Release of dopamine** (associated with pleasure and "rewards")
	- **Reduction in cortisol** (anxiety from not having checked phone in a while results in increased cortisol) 
	- In addition, the **intermittent reinforcement** (which is what makes gambling so addictive) inherent to device-checking further perpetuates these compulsive behaviors

- **Cognitive consequences** of the attention-grabbing Internet
	- As early as 2012, researchers found that 85% of teachers endorsed the statement that "today's digital technologies are creating an easily distracted generation" (Pew Research Center, 2012)
- Study of individuals who engaged in "heavy" (i.e., frequent and extensive) media multi-tasking compared to those who did not
	- Cognitive testing of the two groups found that, surprisingly, those involved in heavy media multi-tasking performed worse in task-switching tests than their counterparts
	- Closer inspection of data indicated that this was due increased susceptibility to distraction from irrelevant environmental stimuli (Ophir, Nass, & Wagner, 2009)
- Though some studies have failed to find adverse effects of internet use on attention, _overall_, the literature does seem to indicate that those who engage in frequent and extensive media multi-tasking perform worse in various cognitive tasks, particularly for sustained attention (Uncapher & Wagner, 2018)
- Lastly, the first longitudinal study (3-6 months) of media multi-tasking in young people found that frequent multi-tasking behaviors
	- Predicted the development of attentional deficits in early adolescents (11-13), though not in older teens (14-16) (Baumgartner, van der Schuur, Lemmens et al., 2017)

----

- **Neuroimaging research** may account for these cognitive deficits
	- Heavy media multi-taskers require greater cognitive effort (increased activation of right prefrontal) to maintain concentration when faced with distractor stimuli (Moisala, Salmela, Hietajärvi et al., 2016)
	- Structurally, high levels of Internet usage and heavy media multi-tasking are associated with **decreased gray matter** in **prefrontal regions** associated with maintaining goals in face of distraction (e.g., **right frontal and anterior cingulate cortex**) (Kühn, Gallinat, & Brains, 2015; Loh & Kanai, 2014) 
	- Even short-term engagement with an extensively hyperlinked online environment (e.g., online shopping for 15 minutes) reduces attentional scope for a sustained duration after coming offline
		- Reading a magazine does not produce these deficits (Peng, Chen, Zhao et al., 2018)

## Memory

- Research has shown that the ability to access information online causes people to become more likely to remember where these facts could be retrieved rather than the **facts themselves**
	* Although storage of information online is beneficial at a group level, using this type of externally stored or "transactive memory" reduces an individual’s ability to recall the specifics of the externally stored information (Sparrow, Liu, & Wegner, 2011)
- In addition, there is evidence that this is impairing people’s ability for analytical or critical thinking
	- If you know where to find the information (online) rather than the information itself, you'll be worse off
	- Research has shown that analytical thinkers, with higher cognitive capacities, actually use their smartphone less for transactive memory in day-to-day situations compared to individuals with non-analytical thinking styles (Barr, Pennycook, Stolz et al., 2015)
	* May this in part explain the dramatic rise in popularity of conspiracy theories?!
- Also, studies have found that increased reliance on the internet for information may cause individuals to "blur the lines" between their own capabilities and their devices’
	* Result is an **over-inflation of self-perceived knowledge** (Hamilton & Yao, 2018; Fisher, Goddu, & Keil, 2015)


## Social cognitive effects

- Social media companies capitalize on people’s innate desire for positive feedback from others to maximally engage (and "addict") users (e.g., via "friends," "followers," and "likes")
	- However, growing evidence indicates that **relying on online feedback for self-esteem** can have adverse effects on young people, increasing anxiety and depression (Vannucci, Flannery, & Ohannessian, 2017; Lin, Sidani, Shensa et al., 2016) 
- In addition, the tendency to make upward social comparisons can be hijacked by the artificial environment manufactured on social media -- no one really has a "Facebook life"!
	- This may lead to unrealistic expectations of oneself, poor body image, and negative self-concept, especially in younger people
- Among adolescents (particularly females), those who spent more time on social media and smartphones have a greater prevalence of mental health problems, including depression (Twenge, Joiner, Rogers et al., 2017)
	- Compared with those who spend 1 hour/day, those who spend more than 5 hours/day had a 66% increased risk of a suicide-related outcome (Twenge, Joiner, Martin et al., 2018)

---

- On the other hand though, the Internet may also potentially provide mental health **benefits**
	- As we will see later, AI programs have also been developed that can analyze Facebook or Instagram posts to effectively screen for depression and suicide risk (Eichstaedt, Smith, Merchant et al., 2018; Reece & Danforth, 2017)
	- Many types of online "virtual therapies" for mental illness are also being developed

## Age Factor

- As discussed above, adverse attentional effects of digital multi-tasking are particularly pronounced in early adolescence (even compared to older teens)
- In addition, higher frequency of internet use over 3 years in children has been linked to
	- Decreased verbal intelligence at follow-up and
    - Impeded maturation of both gray and white matter regions (Takeuchi, Taki, Asano et al. , 2018)
- On the other hand, for older adults experiencing cognitive decline, Internet use may provide cognitive benefits
	- The online environment may provide a new source of positive cognitive stimulation
		- Studies have found that computer games available online and through smartphones can be used to attenuate aging-related cognitive decline (Kühn, Gleich, Lorenz et al., 2014; Anguera, Boccanfuso, Rintoul et al, 2013)
	- In addition, older adults may potentially be able to use social media to overcome isolation
    	- This in turn enables them to reap the physical, mental and neurocognitive benefits associated with social connection (Wellman B., 2001)
