# notes

Using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) + [book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/) theme. Feel free to point out or even correct mistakes by creating an [issue](https://github.com/Mehvix/notes/issues/new)/[PR](https://github.com/Mehvix/notes/compare) or through reaching out to any of my contacts listed on [my website](https://www.mehvix.com).

# contributing

Make a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mehvix/notes). You only have to edit the `master` branch, GH actions generate the site after each push in the `gh-pages` branch (so ignore it). 

When cloning this repository, you will (probably) have to run the following command to pull the book theme submodule:
```cmd
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
