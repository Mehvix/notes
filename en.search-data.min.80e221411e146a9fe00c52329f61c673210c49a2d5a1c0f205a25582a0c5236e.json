Second, check if they intersect by setting the two parametric equations equal to one another:  .$x_1 + t a_1 = x_2 + s a_2; y_1 + t b_1 = y_2 + s b_2; z_1 + t c_1 = z_2 + s c_2$ If an equation exists (that is, there is a valid .$t$ and .$s$) then they intersect at .$L_1(t)$ or .$L_2(s)$     Intersection line .$L$ of two planes  Set one of the 3D variables to zero (e.x. .$z=0$) to find where the two planes intersect the remaining plane (in this case the .$z$ plane) We find the intersection point .$P (\\alpha, \\beta, 0)$ by solving when our plane equations in the prior equation are equal Since the line .$L$ is orthogonal to both planes' normal vectors, our direction vector is .$\\vec v = n_1 \\times n_2 = \\langle a,b,c \\rangle$ We can then plug in everything into the symmetric equation: .$\\frac{x-\\alpha}{a} = \\frac{y-\\beta}{b} = \\frac{z-0}{c}$   Distance from point to plane  Given point .$P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and plane .$ax+by+cz+d=0$ $$D = \\Vert \\text{comp}_{\\vec n}{\\vec b} \\Vert = \\frac{\\vert ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 +d\\vert}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}$$   Distance from skew line to skew line  Given .$L_1 = \\langle x_1, y_1, z_1 \\rangle + t \\vec v_1$ and .$L_2 = \u0026hellip;$   Find the plane containing .$L_2$ that is parallel to .$L_1$. .$P_3 = \\langle x- x_2, y - y_2, z - z_2 \\rangle \\cdot (v_1 \\times v_2)$ Find the .$D$istance from .$x_1, y_1, z_1$ on .$L_1$ to the plane .$P_3$ above $$D = \\frac{\\vert a_3 x_1 + b_3 y_1 + c_3 z_1 +d\\vert}{\\sqrt{a_3^2 + b_3^2 + c_3^2}}$$   Distance from point to line  Given line .$L = \\langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \\rangle + \\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ and point .$P = \\langle P_x, P_y, P_z \\rangle$   Write a distance equation as .$D^2 = ((x_0 + ta) - P_x)^2 + ((y_0 + tb) - P_y)^2 + ((z_0 + tc) - P_z)^2$ Find the minimum value of .$t$ and plug in into the equation above and find .$D$ (but not .$D^2$!)    12.6 Cylinders and Quadratic Surfaces #  Traces #    Cross sections of a surface found by taking a three-variable equation and setting one of the equations variables equal to a constant.

This can be graphed with a dotted line following the curve .$x = y^2$   For the equation .$z = f(x,y)$, .$x,y$ are the independent variables and .$z$ is the dependent variable \u0026ndash; similar to single variable equations We can visualize functions of two variables (i.e .$f(x,y)$) by graphing them in 3D as .$(x,y,f(x,y))$  We can then write level curves for the function by setting .$f(x,y) = k$ for some .$k$onstant in the range of .$f$. This will result in a graph similar to a Topographic map Level Curve: The level curves of a function .$f$ of two variables are the curves with equations .$f(x,y) = k$, where .$k$ is a constant (in the range of .$f$).      14.2 Limits and Continuity #  Limits #   Vector Limit: Let .$f$ be a function of two variables whose domain .$D$ includes points arbitrarily close to .$(a, b)$. Then we say that the limit of .$f(x, y)$ as .$(x, y)$ approaches .$a, b.$ is .$L$ and we write $$\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)} f(x,y) = L$$ if for every number .$\\varepsilon \u0026lt; 0$ there is a corresponding number .$\\delta \u0026lt; 0$ such that if .$(x, y) \\in D$ and .$0 \u0026lt; \\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2} \u0026lt; \\delta$ then .$\\vert f(x,y) - L \\vert \u0026lt; \\varepsilon$   Notice that .$\\vert f(x,y) - L \\vert$ is the distance between the numbers .$f(x, y)$ and .$L$, and .$\\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2}$ is the distance between the point .$(x, y)$ and the point .$(a, b)$. If .$f(x,y) \\to L_1$ as .$(x,y) \\to (a,b)$ along a path .$C_1$ and .$f(x,y) \\to L_2$ as .$(x,y) \\to (a,b)$ along a path .$C_2$, where .$L_1 \\neq L_2$, then .$\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)} f(x,y)$, does not exist.  We can test this by setting .$x$ and .$y$ to various different values (e.x. .$x=0, y=0, x=y, \u0026hellip;,$ etc)    Continuity #  A function .$f$ of two variables is called continuous at .$(a,b)$ if $$\\lim_{(x,y)\\to (a,b)} f(x,y) = f(a,b)$$ We say .$f$ is continuous on .$D$ if .$f$ is continuous at every point .$(a,b)$ in .$D$.   That is, we need the limit to exist ands for .$f(a,b)$ to be defined Continuos functions: .$x,y, c, \\text{ trig (on domain)}$ Arithmetic, composition, exponent all preserve continuity (on domain!) Dividing doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily preserve continuity  14.3 Partial Derivatives #  If .$f$ is a function of two variables, its partial derivatives are the functions .$f_x$ and .$f_y$ defined by $$f_x(x,y) = \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x} = \\lim_{h\\to0} \\frac{f(x+h,y)-f(x,y)}{h}$$ $$f_y(x,y) = \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta y} = \\lim_{h\\to0} \\frac{f(x,y+h)-f(x,y)}{h}$$   Notice we use .$\\delta$ instead of .$d$ for partial derivatives These can be written at a single point .$(a,b)$ with respect to .$x$ and .$y$ by treating the remaining variables as a constant $$f_x(a,b) = g'(a); \\ \\ \\ g(x) = f(x,b)$$ $$f_y(a,b) = h'(b); \\ \\ \\ h(y) = f(a,y)$$ Which can be extrapolated for 3 (or more) variables: $$f_z(a,b,c) = k'(c); \\ \\ \\ k(z) = f(a,b,z)$$  Higher Derivatives #   Just like regular derivatives, we can do many partial derivatives For example, the following are second partial derivatives of .$z=f(x,y)$: $$(f_x)_x = f_{xx} = \\frac{\\delta }{\\delta x}\\bigg(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x}\\bigg) = \\frac{\\delta^2f}{\\delta x^2}$$ $$(f_x)_y = f_{xy} = \\frac{\\delta }{\\delta y}\\bigg(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x}\\bigg) = \\frac{\\delta^2f}{\\delta y \\delta x}$$ $$(f_y)_x = f_{yx} = \\frac{\\delta }{\\delta x}\\bigg(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta y}\\bigg) = \\frac{\\delta^2f}{\\delta x \\delta y}$$ $$(f_y)_y = f_{yy} = \\frac{\\delta }{\\delta y}\\bigg(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta y}\\bigg) = \\frac{\\delta^2f}{\\delta y^2}$$  Clairaut‚Äôs Theorem Suppose .$f$ is defined on a disk .$D$ that contains the point .$(a,b)$. If the functions .$f_{xy}$ and .$f_{yx}$ are both continuous on .$D$, then $$f_{xy}(a,b) = f_{yx}(a,b)$$  Partial Differential Equations #   In the sciences, we typically want to find how a system changes with respect to multiple variables Partial derivatives occur in partial differential equations, e.x Laplace\u0026rsquo;s Equation: $$ \\frac{\\delta^2 u}{\\delta x^2} + \\frac{\\delta^2 u}{\\delta y^2} = 0$$  Solutions to Laplace\u0026rsquo;s are always harmonic functions, such as .$u=e^x \\sin(y)$    14.4 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations #  Tangent Planes #   Tangent planes are to surfaces as tangent lines are to curves  Tangent planes contain both the partial derivative lines w.r.t .$x$ and .$y$   All we need to know to write a tangent plane is a point .$(a,b)$ and direction of the two partial derivatives .$\\langle 1,0, f_x(a,b)\\rangle, \\langle 0,1, f_y(a,b)\\rangle$  Direction vector can be found with .$\\langle 1,0, f_x(a,b)\\rangle \\times \\langle 0,1, f_y(a,b)\\rangle = \\langle -f_x, -f_y, 1 \\rangle$ which we can dot with .$\\langle x-x_0, y-y_0, z-f(x_0,y_0) \\rangle$    Suppose .$f$ has continuous partial derivatives. An equation of the tangent plane to the surface .$z = f(x, y)$ at the point .$P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is $$z-f(x_0, y_0) = f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y-y_0)$$  Linear Approximations #   As we get very close to the surface, then the tangent plane (at point .$(a,b)$) looks more and more like the surface  Thus, we can use it to for making approximations when we are near near .$(a,b)$ If .$z=f(x,y)$, then .$f$ is differentiable at .$(a,b)$ if .$\\Delta z$ can be expressed in the form $$\\Delta z = f_x(a,b)\\Delta x + f_y(a,b)\\Delta y + \\varepsilon_1 \\Delta x + \\varepsilon_2 \\Delta y$$ where the error terms, .$\\varepsilon_1$ and .$\\varepsilon_2 \\to 0$ as .$(\\Delta x, \\Delta y) \\to (0,0)$.     Rewriting this, we can use the given .$f(x,y,z)$ to write an estimate for point/state .$f(a,b,c)$ $$f(x,y,z) \\approx f(a,b,c) + f_x(a,b,c) (x-a) + f_y(a,b,c)(y-b) + f_z(a,b,c) (z-c)$$  Differentials #   With one variable functions, i.e. .$y=f(x)$, we defined the differential .$dx$ to be independent so we had to write .$dy$ as .$dy = f'(x)\\ dx$ Given a differentiable function of two variables, i.e. .$z=f(x,y)$, we know both .$dx$ and .$dy$ are independent so we write: $$dz = f_x(x,y)\\ dx + f_y(x,y)\\ dy = \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta x}dx + \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta y}dy$$ If the partial derivatives .$f_x$ and .$f_y$ exist near .$(a,b)$ and are continuous at .$(a,b)$, then .$f$ is differentiable at .$(a,b)$.

The lower curves are not hyperbolas, because the gas is no longer an ideal gas. (b) An expanded portion of the diagram for low temperatures, where the phase can change from a gas to a liquid.   Phase changes can only be explained if we\u0026rsquo;re considering the behavior of a real \u0026ndash; not ideal \u0026ndash; gas  This is because phase changes involve intermolecular bonds which we only factor in when considering real gases   At high enough pressures, gases take up less volume than expected.  This effect is magnified with lower temperatures   At lower temperatures, the .$PE$ attractive forces between particles aren\u0026rsquo;t negligible with respect to .$KE$ At the critical points, (when .$PV$ curve is horizontal) gases may no longer change to liquid under any pressure  This point varies by substance Gas below the critical point is vapor Gas above the critical point is just gas /shrug   Sublimation: When substance changes from solid to gas, skipping liquefaction step     Ideal gases would have a straight line along a .$PV/nRT \\text{ vs } P$ graph Real gases vary don\u0026rsquo;t follow this line and deviate from it proportional to their molecule size and weight (resulting in higher .$a$ and .$b$ values respectively \u0026ndash; see 18.5)  18.4 Vapor, Pressure, and Humidity #  Evaporation #   Molecules in liquid are held tightly together with intermolecular attractive forces (covalent hydrogen bonds) Some molecules may momentarily leave the liquid if their velocity is fast enough  If velocity isn\u0026rsquo;t too large, then the particle will be pulled back to the liquid surface If velocity is large enough, then the particle will break the intermolecular bonds and leave the liquid to enter their gas form  Low probability of occurring     Because .$v_{\\text{particle}} \\propto T$, the .$\\text{evaporation rate} \\propto T$ As fast moving (thus hot) particles leave the liquid, the liquid\u0026rsquo;s temperature decreases  That is, evaporation is a cooling process    Vapor Pressure #   A typical phase diagram.

When this state is reached, the space above the water is considered saturated Pressure of vapor saturation is called (saturated) vapor pressure   Saturated Vapor Pressure varies with the volume of container  If volume above the liquid was reduced, then the density would increase so particles would condense back to liquid Assuming .$T = \\text{constant}$, vapor pressure would stay constant too   Since at high temperatures there are more particles (entering/already in) the vapor phase, higher pressure is required for equilibrium When the volume is large, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that all the liquid evaporates before equilibrium  Boiling #   Boiling occurs when saturated vapor pressure equals external pressure Bubbling forms as temperature approaches boiling temperature  If the pressure in the bubbles are less than the external pressure, the bubbles are crushed Otherwise, bubbles are able to rise to surface   Boiling point is proportional to pressure  Lower pressure = lower temperature required for boiling point    Partial Pressure and Humidity #   In gases composed of multiple other gases, the total pressure is the sum of all partial pressures for each of other sub gas Partial Pressure is the pressure a single gas would exert by itself  The partial pressure of water in the air can be as low as zero and vary up to a maximum equal to the saturated vapor pressure (of water at the given temperature)   Relative Humidity: ratio of partial pressure of water vapor to the saturated vapor pressure at a given temperature $$\\text{Relative Humidity} = \\frac{\\text{partial pressure of }H_2O}{\\text{saturated vapor pressure of }H_2O} \\cdot 100\\%$$ Super Saturation: .$P_{\\text{partial}} \u0026gt;

Isobaric and Isovolumetric (.$\\Delta P = 0, \\Delta V = 0$) #     Isobaric: .$\\Delta P = 0 \\Longrightarrow Q = \\Delta E_\\text{int} + W = \\Delta E_\\text{int} + P\\Delta V$. The heat transferred to the system does work, but also changes the internal energy of the system  Isovolumetric: .$\\Delta V = 0 \\Longrightarrow W = 0 \\Longrightarrow Q = \\Delta E_\\text{int}$. The thermodynamic process is the addition or removal of heat. First law of thermo holds for both of these processes  $$$$ $$$$ $$W_{\\text{Isovol.}} = 0$$ $$W_{\\text{Isobaric}} = \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} P \\ dV$$ $$\u0026hellip; = P \\Delta V$$ $$\u0026hellip; = P_B(V_B - V_A)$$ $$\u0026hellip; = nRT_B(1 - \\frac{V_A}{V_B})$$     Work done in volume changes (.$\\Delta V \\neq 0$) #   For quasistatic processes: $$dW = \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = PA d\\vec{l} = P\\ dV \\ \\ \\ \\text{(1)}$$ $$W = \\int dW = \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} P\\ dV \\ \\ \\ \\text{(2)}$$ .$\\text{(1)}$ Where .$F = PA$ is the force the gas exerts on the piston and .$d\\vec{l}$ is the (small) distance the piston moves .$\\text{(2)}$ This shows that the work done is the area under the .$PV$ curve  This equations are valid for work done in any volume change (solid, liquids, gas)   .$W$ (and even .$Q$) depends on the initial and final states and also on the process (or path)  19.8 Molar Specific Heats for Gases and Equipartition of Energy #  Molar Specific Heat #   Specific heat for gases depends heavily on the process and how it\u0026rsquo;s carried out Specific heat for constant pressure and constant volume vary We use molar specific heat for gases: .$C_V$ and .$C_P$ which are defined as the heat required to raise .$1 \\text{ mol}$ of gas by .$1^\\circ \\text{ C}$ at a constant volume or pressure respectively. We then use .$n$ instead of .$m$ in our heat equations: $$\\Delta Q = nC_V \\Delta T = mc_V \\Delta T\\ \\ \\ \\text{[Constant Volume]}$$ $$\\Delta Q = nC_P \\Delta T = mc_P \\Delta T\\ \\ \\ \\text{[Constant Pressure]}$$ which we can then relate to the specific heat with .$M$ as the molecular mass of the gas, .$m/n$ in grams/mol: $$C_V = Mc_V$$ $$C_p = Mc_p$$ In a heating process, when .$\\Delta V = 0$ then the heat added, .$Q_V$ goes entirely into internal energy: .$Q_V = \\Delta E_\\text{int}$ However, when pressure is constant work is done. Thus, heat added, .$Q_P$, goes towards increasing internal energy and work: .$W=P\\Delta V$  Therefore, more heat is needed for a constant pressure system: .$Q_P = \\Delta E_\\text{int} + P\\Delta V$   Since .$\\Delta E_\\text{int}$ is the same for both processes, we can write .$Q_P - Q_V = P \\Delta V$  With an ideal gas, we know .$V = nRT/P$ so .$\\Delta V = nR\\Delta T/P$ which we can combine with the prior equations to get: $$nC_P\\Delta T - nC_V \\Delta T = P\\bigg(\\frac{nR\\Delta T}{P}\\bigg) \\Longrightarrow C_P - C_V = R$$   We can also relate internal energy to molar specific heat for gases at constant volumes: $$\\Delta E_\\text{int} = Q_V \\Longrightarrow \\frac{\\text{[Deg. of Freedom]}}{2}nRT = nC_V\\Delta T \\Longrightarrow C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$$ We can then plug in our new value for .$C_V$ into the second to last equation .$C_P - C_V = R$ to get .$C_P = \\frac{5}{2}R$ for a monatomic gas. We can also combine our equations to write a relation between internal energy and temperature again: $$\\Delta E_\\text{int} = nC_V \\Delta T$$  Equipartition of Energy #    Degrees of Freedom: The number of independent ways a molecule can posses energy  Degrees of freedom depend on the temperature At low temperatures, the only degree of freedom is from translational .$KE$  Starting after .$0K$ Diatomic gas: .$C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$ (3 for each axis) Sum of .$\\frac{1}{2}m \\langle v_x, v_y, v_z \\rangle$   At \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; temperatures, the molecules posses rotation energy  Around .$50K$ Diatomic gas: .$C_V = \\frac{5}{2}R$ Sum of .$\\frac{1}{2}I \\langle 0, \\omega_y, \\omega_z \\rangle$ (since it\u0026rsquo;s rotating about .$\\hat x$ meaning .$E_{\\text{rotational, }x}) = 0$   At higher temperatures, the molecules gain energy associated with their vibrations:  Around .$1000K$ One from KE of the molecules vibrating back and forth: .$\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\text{COM}}^2$ The second from PE of the vibrational motion (think of this as a spring\u0026rsquo;s PE): .$\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$   Solids:  The molar temperature of solids at high temperatures is close to .$3R$.

Also, we use .$Q=mc \\Delta T$ to find heat and use half .$T_{M}$ (in this case .$2^\\circ C$) for .$\\Delta T$ Since .$T_{HM} \u0026gt; T_{LM}, \\Delta S \u0026gt; 0$ is always true While one system may decrease in entropy, the other one always increases more so net always increases   For adiabatic processes, we know .$dQ = dW = P dV$, thus $$\\Delta S_\\text{gas} = \\int \\frac{dQ}{T} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P\\ dV$$ and since we know through the idea gas law that .$P=nRT/V$ so $$\u0026hellip;= \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\frac{nRT}{V}\\ dV = nR \\ \\ln \\bigg(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\bigg)$$  20.7 Order to Disorder #   If we say that entropy is a measure of (dis)order in a system, we can write the second law as  Natural processes tend to move toward a state of greater disorder\n  When ice melts to water at 0¬∞C, the entropy of the water increases.  Intuitively, we can think of solid water, ice, as being more ordered than the less orderly fluid state which can flow all over the place. This change from order to disorder can be seen more clearly from the molecular point of view: the orderly arrangement of water molecules in an ice crystal has changed to the disorderly and somewhat random motion of the molecules in the fluid state.   When a hot substance is put in contact with a cold substance, heat flows from the high temperature to the low until the two substances reach the same intermediate temperature.  At the beginning of the process we can distinguish two classes of molecules: those with a high average kinetic energy (the hot object), and those with a low average kinetic energy (the cooler object). After the process in which heat flows, all the molecules are in one class with the same average kinetic energy; we no longer have the more orderly arrangement of molecules in two classes \u0026ndash; Order has gone to disorder Furthermore, the separate hot and cold objects could serve as the hot and cold-temperature regions of a heat engine, and thus could be used to obtain useful work. But once the two objects are put in contact and reach the same temperature, no work can be obtained. Disorder has increased, because a system that has the ability to perform work must surely be considered to have a higher order than a system no longer able to do work.   When a stone falls to the ground, its macroscopic kinetic energy is transformed to thermal energy.  Thermal energy is associated with the disorderly random motion of molecules, but the molecules in the falling stone all have the same velocity downward in addition to their own random velocities. Thus, the more orderly kinetic energy of the stone as a whole (which could do useful work) is changed to disordered thermal energy when the stone strikes the ground. Disorder increases in this process, as it does in all processes that occur in nature.    20.8 Unavailability of Energy; Heat Death #   In any natural process, some energy becomes unavailable to do useful work\n  That is, as time goes on, both energy is degraded and entropy increases  A rock that falls to the ground could instead used it\u0026rsquo;s energy towards useful work versus exerting kinetic/thermal energy while falling Two separate hot and cold objects could serves as the high and low temperature regions for a heat engine (obtaining useful work). Instead, if the tow objects are put in contact with one another, they\u0026rsquo;ll eventually reach the same uniform temperature and not be able to do any work.   Heat Death: All energy of the universe degrades into thermal energy  Very far out Scientists are unsure whether this is inevitable or whether we can even extrapolate the 2nd law to the scale of our universe    20.9 Statistical Interpretation of Entropy/2nd #   We can only realistically observe macrostates and not microstates  However, we can make inferences about microstates with probabilities Each microstate is equally probable of occurring Thus, the number of microstates that give the same macrostate correspond to the relative probability of that macrostate occurring   The most probable state of a gas is one in which the molecules take up the whole spaces and move about randomly (in a maxwell distribution) At the same time, the very orderly arrangement of all molecules located in one corner of the room and all moving with the same velocity is extremely unlikely Therefore, the probability is directly related to the disorder and hence entropy of the system  The most probably state is the one with greatest entropy or greatest disorder and randomness It\u0026rsquo;s also the macrostate that corresponds to the most microstates   The netropy of a system in a given macro state can be written as: $$ S = k \\ \\ln\\mathscr{W}$$ .$k$ is the Boltzmann\u0026rsquo;s constant and .$\\mathscr{W}$ is the number of microstates corresponding to the given macrostate  That is, .$\\mathscr{W}$ is proportional to the probability of occurrence of that state .$\\mathscr{W}$ is also called the thermodynamic probability or the disorder parameter    20.10 Thermo Temperature; Third Law #   Ideal Carnot Cycles always have the ratio $$\\frac{Q_L}{Q_H} = \\frac{T_L}{T_H}$$ Note that this relation doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on the working substance, thus it can server as the basis for the Kelvin scale The closer a temperature is to abs zero, the more difficult it is to reduce the temp further Third Law:  It is not possible to reach absolute zero in any finite number of processes\n  Thus, since .$e = 1 - \\frac{T_L}{T_H}$ and because .$T_L$ can\u0026rsquo;t ever be zero then 100% efficiency is never possible  "},{"id":8,"href":"/physics-7b/21/","title":"21: Electric Charges \u0026 Fields","section":"Physics 7B","content":"21.1 Static Electricity; Electric Charge and its Conservation #   \u0026ldquo;Charged\u0026rdquo; objects posses a net electric charge Unlike charges attract; like charges repel  Charges on glass are positive, charges on plastic is negative   Law of Conservation of Electric Charge: Whenever a certain amount of charge is produced in one object, an equal amount of the opposite type of charge is produced in another object  E.x. a plastic ruler is rubbed with a paper towel. The plastic acquires a negative charge and the towel obtains an equal positive charge In other words, the net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero    21.2 Electric Charge in the Atom #   Atoms are made up of positive nucleus surrounded by at least one negatively charged electron.  Inside the nucleus are protons which are positively charged and neutrons which have no charge The charges of electrons and protons are equal in magnitude   E.x. neutral atoms with no charge contain an equal number of protons and electrons When an atom gains a charge (by losing/gaining electrons), it then has a net charge and is called an ion Neutral objects have a net charge of zero  Over time, objects left alone with a charge tend to lose their charge This is because over time, electrons are exchanged with water molecules in the air  Water molecules are polar: They are neutral, their charges aren\u0026rsquo;t equally distributed   Thus, on rainy days it\u0026rsquo;s harder for an object to maintain a charge for too long    21.3 Insulators and Conductors #   Conductor: Material that allows charge to flow between objects  Metals tend to be good conductors Electrons are relatively lose: can move freely within metal, but can\u0026rsquo;t leave easily  Called free or conduction electrons     Insulator: Opposite of conductors; don\u0026rsquo;t easily allow a flow of charge  Most materials other than metals tend to be good insulators  Notably rubber and wood   Electrons are bound very tightly to the nuclei Almost no free electrons   Semiconductors: Somewhere between the two former  Silicon, germanium Less free electrons than a conductor, but more than an insulator    21.4 Induced Charge; Electroscope #   Conduction: Charge transfer by physical contact  E.x. a positively charged metal rod touches a neutral metal rod. Free electrons from the neutral rod will then flow to the charged rod, leaving the formerly neutral rod now slightly positively charged   Induction: Charge distribution altered by bringing two objects close, but not touching Grounded Objects  Objects can be ground to the earth with a conducting wire The earth is very large and can conduct, so it easily accepts/gives up electrons Therefore, when an object is induced by another charged object, the original objects will become charged If the wire is ever cut when the object is under induction, the charge will stay in the object    Electroscope  21.5 Coulomb\u0026rsquo;s Law #  Coulomb\u0026rsquo;s Law: $$F = k \\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$$ where .$k$ is a constant equal to .$8.988 \\cdot 10^9 \\text{ N m$^2$/C$^2$}$   Very similar to universal gravitation equation  However, gravity is always attractive whereas charges can repel   The coulomb (.$\\text{C}$) is the SI unit for charge The smallest charge we\u0026rsquo;ve observed is the elementary charge: .$e = 1.6022 \\cdot 10^{-19} \\text{ C}$  Electrons have a charge equal to .$-e$ Protons have a charge equal to .$+e$ Ideally, all charges are multiples of .$e$   .$k$ can also be written as .$\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0}$  .$\\varepsilon_0$ is called the permittivity of free space .$\\varepsilon_0 = \\frac{1}{4\\pi k} = 8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\text{C$^2$/N m$^2$}$    21.6 Electric Field #   Electric fields extend outward from every charge and permeates all of space $$\\overrightarrow E = \\lim_{q\\to0}\\frac{\\overrightarrow F}{q}$$  .$q$ is a positive charge .$\\overrightarrow F$ is the forces the field exserts on .$q$ Has units newtons per coulomb (.$\\text{N/C}$)   We can combine this with Coulomb\u0026rsquo;s law to get $$\\overrightarrow E = \\frac{kqQ/r^2}{q} = k \\frac{Q}{r^2}$$  We see that .$\\overrightarrow E$ is independent of the particle .$q$ .$Q$ is the particle that is responsible for the field in the first place   An electric field at a given point is the sum of all other electric fields that act on that point $$\\overrightarrow E = \\overrightarrow E_1 + \\overrightarrow E_2 + \u0026hellip;$$  21.7 Electric Field Calculations for Continuous Charge Distributions #   We can extend our previous definition to calculus as $$\\overrightarrow E = \\int d \\overrightarrow E$$ When solving problems, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to use symmetry, check charge direction, and (when applicable) use bounds of .$r \\in [0, \\infty]$ This chapters has lots of good conceptual examples We can write equation for an infinite plane holding a uniform surface charge density .$\\sigma$ $$\\overrightarrow E = \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\varepsilon_0}$$  This also applies in the case where a charge is close to an infinite surface (so that the distance to the surface is much greater than the distance to the edges)    21.8 Field Lines #   To visualize electric fields, we draw electric field lines or lines of force Three properties of Electric Field Lines:  Electric field lines indicate the direction of the electric field; the field points in the direction tangent to the field line at any point \u0026ndash; see point .$P$ in .$\\text{(a)}$ The lines are drawn so that the magnitude of the electric field, .$E$, is proportional to the number of lines crossing unit area perpendicular to the lines.

Natural Biospheric Fire \u0026ndash; Natural Fire Regime #   (Potential) start date for pyrogeography During Silurian and Devonian Periods (440-400 HYA) Natural fire regime started during this period because it was the first time that the fire triangle came together Fire triangle:  Ignition Source: (Since beginning) Natural ignition from lightening (most common), volcanoes, (rarely) falling rock sparks  These natural sources tend to only begin fires in the dry season Lightening is most common in mountain regions (over a costal region)   Oxygen Source: (Cambrian period) Atmospheric Oxygen (from photosynthetic plants) leads to appearance of photosynthetic organisms Fuel Source: (Silurian and Devonian Periods) Enough terrestrial plants in ecosystems to acts as fuel   During this time, natural fire regimes evolved  As coal became more common (Carboniferous period), fires did too   Started long time ago, before humans and dinosaurs  2. Wildland Anthropogenic Fire \u0026ndash; Hunter/Gatherer Fire Regime #   When people began acting as the ignition source Primarily used fire for domestic cases  Heating, cooking, warmth, etc.   When people move to a new land  Major changes in fauna, vegetation, and fires (charcoal) People seem to bring fire with them as they migrate   Start dates  40 ka for Australia  90% of fauna went extinct Lots of evidence of fire   45 ka for Highland New Guinea 50 ka for lowland Borneo 20 ka for the Americas  Extinctions of many animals and vegetation  Debate: are these because of natural process like climate change (ice age -\u0026gt; post ice age?) or do people play a large role   Native Perspective ‚Äì Indigenous people have been here since time began      When did humans actually discover fire? #   Defining the bridge between phase one and two is difficult Definition problems  Do we ask when did (modern humans / hominin ancestors) develop the ability to control and utilize fire? We also need to distinguish between (1) controlling / utilizing fire and (2) being able to start a fire on a whim   Archeological problems  Fire exists naturally, so we can\u0026rsquo;t assume all fire evidence is from human action Other natural processes can look like fire (e.g. staining by minerals in soil, oxidation causing reddish patches) Combustion of natural objects (e.g. bushes) can leave charcoal which looks like a human hearth  Additionally, evidence of a hearth doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that humans started/controlled fire   Provides a single snapshot, has little temporal depth   Archaeological Record Analysis  In the field:  Observation and collection of materials Study the geology of the site   In the lab:  Microscopic analysis to see if there was burning If so, could the location of the sample been transported after combustion? Further, how does the history of the burned object associate with cultural items      How long has fire been controlled? #   Europe: Strong evidence of 400,000 - 300,000 years ago Western Asia: One established case from 780,000 years ago. Other sites are similar to Europe Africa: Claims have been made for a cave site that shows fire around 1.5-1.6 million years ago Note that opportunistic use of fire could have happened much earlier  Eg. lighting a torch from a natural-starting forest fire    3.

Industrial and Domestic Anthropogenic Fire \u0026ndash; Industrial Fire Regime #   Low-severity surface fire regimes are being replaced with low-frequency, high-intensity crown fires that are outside the historical range of variability for these ecosystems Western US: forests have also experienced an increase in hazardous fuels due to highly effective fire suppression policy that excluded fires for much of the 20th century Eastern US: Fire suppression has shifted oak and pine woodlands to mesophytic hardwoods consequently reducing flammability and fire activity Globally: urban areas have steadily expanded into wildland areas  Producing more ignition sources (arson and accidental) Exposing more people to wildfire    Key Factors in Fire Regimes (Discussion 8-30) #   Frequency  The interval of fire occurrences E.x. every four years   Area  Size, distribution, location Ground fires (primarily dead plants) vs crown (burning upper canopy of living trees)  Crown fires areas are more difficult to manage because controlled burns still damage natural resources     Severity  How destructive a fire is (high mortality = high severity) Change in dominant species / change in ecosystem Quantifiable by how much soil on the ground is visible   Seasonality  How the season affects fires May or may not be annual May arise due to weather conditions Ex.

As such, humans have evolved around a cooked diet that they can\u0026rsquo;t live without Led to fitness advantage More energy + nutrient from food, enabling body and brain size increase Detoxing effect Increase digestibility of all food Cooking takes time, leading to social development  Distribution of tasks among group: (collection, preparation, even stealing)   Cooking accounts for reduction in jaw, tooth size (due to softer food), stomach, and digestive system size There is no evidence of modern human societies existing without cooked food Counterpoints:  It\u0026rsquo;s still unclear that Homo erectus controlled fire There are some sites that show no example of cooking: e.g. Neanderthal sites in cold climates Energetic effects aren\u0026rsquo;t well quantified Digestive evolution may not have been linear; other adaptations related to fire occurred after Homo erectus     Protection benefits at night (especially versus the alternative: sleeping in trees) Allowed much better vision in caves  Enables cave art   Evidence that some hominids could use fire to morph certain woods into tools (e.g. digging sticks, hafted spears) Allowed humans to colonize colder environments Increase prey abundances, maintain mosaic landscapes, and increase pyrodiversity and succession stage heterogeneity   Social bonding  Led to camp fires Allows people to stay up later Fire could be used as a story telling enhancer, means to pass on history, culture, etc. Provides a sense of intimacy and openness Opportunity for music    Fire-stick farming  clearing ground for human habitats facilitating travel killing vermin, hunting regenerating plant food sources for both humans and livestock warfare among tribes   Woody, closed-canopy shrublands were opened up or entirely displaced  Led to spread of fast-growing annual species that provided greater seed resources, travel, and hunting and planting opportunities Ex. CA land was only used for agriculture after burnings, which led to many other alien plants spreading too Reductions in arboreal cover and woody understory have the most potential to enhance erosion Reshaping of landscapes has posed problems for ecologists trying to understand contemporary landscape patterns    Overview of Fires in California #   Conflagrating California\n ~54% of CA ecosystems depend on fire The remaining ecosystems that aren\u0026rsquo;t too extreme for fires (so not deserts, stony summits, wetlands, etc.) are fire adapted  \u0026ldquo;Fire season is 13 months\u0026rdquo;\n  CA has a diverse ecosystem; each site is similar to another one elsewhere though What sets CA apart is the scale and intensity of it\u0026rsquo;s fires    CA\u0026rsquo;s fires are unique in that they lead national discourse Texas views the US as France views the EUnion \u0026ndash; a canvas to project it\u0026rsquo;s ideals Alaska view the US as a source of subsidies. It\u0026rsquo;s isolated and treated almost as a commonwealth. California shares sizes, political isolation, and sense of selfhood with the aforementioned.  Unlike AL, it has a strong and wide economy Unlike TX, it has been independent but not secessionist and, while CA and TX both have strong cultures, CA doesn\u0026rsquo;t project its   Importance - 1/9 Americans live in CA - 8th largest economy - Social uses 1/2 the national fire budget - Source (and testing ground) of new firefighting technology  \u0026ldquo;CA is like the rest of the US, just more so\u0026rdquo;\n     Two CA  North and south Sierra and Seacoast Rich and poor Scrubland, megalopolis, \u0026amp; wilderness Lowest and highest elevation in nation (Mount Whitney @ 14,500 ft and Death Valley @ -280 ft)   Sierra Nevada is analogous to NoCal  Big tilt Highest in SE and slants lower to N + W Mostly timber More frequent fires   Transverse Range is analogous to SoCal  Big Kink Highest in E, bends sharp W then trails to pacific and N Mostly bush More intense fires 56% of ppl live on 8% of land      CA is a national innovator  Created geological survey in 1860 Created Board of Forestry in 1885 Set standard for fire control   Light-burning controversy  Pro-burn:  Frontier practices (the Indian way of forest management) Advocated for regular burning montane woods and lowlands NoCal   Pro-protection  Use govt to prevent\\fight fires SoCal   National issue debated in CA 1923: Light-burning anathematized      Leopold report, Wilderness Act, and Tall Timbers fire ecology conferences  Began in 1962 Aimed to transform fire control into fire management Good for conservation + private land owners who wanted traditional working landscapes Loggers and ranchers started moving out at this time Didn\u0026rsquo;t target urban areas   Urban Areas  Used fire suppression  CA to spawn as AK to wilderness\n  Fires in SoCal rained embers onto cities SoCal retaliated w larger firefighting force   New Practices  Operation Firestop: Transform tech into operational programs 1956: Aerial tankers used to drop retardant on firelines 1961: Specialty fire crews expanded nationally 1963: Forest Service opened Western Fire Lab to coordinate fire suppression w air attacks 1970: Organized SoCal fire agencies towards common practices   Area Specialty  Florida: Prescribed fire N Rockies: Management over back countries (So)Cal: Fire suppression  Land management in Cali was synonymous to fire management, thus fire suppression        As CA grew, the motivation for fire suppression was primarily economical This lead to divisive debates of suppression vs let-burn  When there were flames, it was fight or flight   Many fire ideas spread from CA  Often transformed and simplified      Fires are especially susceptible due to Scioecological Systems (SES)  History of fires suppression Climate change More extreme fire weather Expanding development Droughts   Difficult to predict future fire regimes well Changes in human behavior can amplify, but tend to cancel out climatic effects on fire regimes  For example, humans alter through changing land use, ignitions, fuel conditions, or fire suppression Fire activity is influenced by climate variability  More (less) fire occurred in dry (wet) and warm (cool) years, and high-fire years were preceded by moist and sometimes cool conditions 1‚Äì4 y earlier.   (Sierra Nevada) fire-regime shifts correlate to SES changes, not shifts in climate.   Are best bet is to look at history and see how fire regimes changed from past changes in socioeconomic variables  Climate increased fire activity on a large-scale after Native American depopulation reduced the buffering effect of due to their burnings  Sierra Nevada tribes were hunter-gatherers who used sophisticated burning practices to manage resources The fire index nearly doubled after depopulation   Later Euro-American settlement and fire suppression buffered fire activity from temperature increases  Logging, fire suppression, livestock increase (grazing effects)     The overall sensitivity of fire regimes to low-frequency temperature variation is related to temperature-driven vegetation changes that alter fuel structure and fuel type  Peopling of North America #   Traditional Perspective ‚Äì Clovis First Model  13,000 ka, there was an ice-free corridor that opened up and let people come to north America  People from Asia follow herds of megafauna across Bering Strait ( Beringia)   We have found kill sites across America  Butchered mammoth, horses, bison, ground sloths, etc.     New Thoughts about Peopling of Americas: Multiple Migrations of People 20,000-40,000 years ago Coastal Migration Model:  Use Boats to Come to Americas from Asia Some travels may not have been successful which is why there is less evidence for this theory Based on:  Evidence sophisticated cultures  Art, pottery, (primitive) technology, etc.   Evidence of maritime seafaring at early date (Australia, New Guinea, Japan) People follow the Kelp Highway Maritime  Kelp forests very productive (food source) Kelp Highway went along Pacific Rim        Peopling of California #    Earliest well dated sites in CA (13,000-10,000 BP) [Based on radio carbon dates]\n Sites located in SoCal: Channel Islands, South Coast These Islands have always been separated by water so we know people had boats relatively early    Find Evidence of Shell Middens\n Contain shell, fish, other maritime foods Have evidence of tools for kelp + technology Big Game Kill Sites rare in California Dietary Differences (Midwest/Plains vs California)  Perhaps because of dietary differences Suggests different groups of people, so potentially different groups of migrants      Major Changes observed on Channel Islands\n Changes in Fauna (Pygmy Mammoths) Changes in Flora Evidence of Fires!    Debate about what caused these changes\n Due to\u0026hellip;  Climate Change  Climate change at end of Ice Age  Mega herbivores died after ice age, increasing fuel sources (vegetation) which we can see with charcoal signatures   Causes warming + drying (leading to fire) Changes in vegetation and animals because they couldn\u0026rsquo;t adapt   Comet  Newest theory Estimated that 5km comet hit earth somewhere We\u0026rsquo;ve found comet-diamonds and various sites that have chemical signatures potentially from a comet Cloud from comet would have affected photo-synthetic processes, killing plants + animals   People  People may have over-hunted animals May have brought fire with them     Potentially due to multiple reasons Kent thinks it\u0026rsquo;s likely climate change + people    Concluding Points\n Clearly people knew about fire from earliest times Very Sophisticated Maritime Peoples (Kent‚Äôs opinion) Early for early anthropogenic Influenced fire regimes from earliest times Implications: the Holocene Epoch in CA (last 10,000 years); you cannot assume That only Natural Fire Regimes existed Must consider the influence of people    Historical Fire Records in California #  Methods #   Key Question: What methods can we use to get historical information on fires?  1. Coring Lakes #    Annual layers are laid down in some lakes  Realistically you can date to around fifty years of accuracy This samples have deeper temporal depth vs other methods We can also radiocarbon date these samples to determine the time period   What to sample  Charcoal present is indicates fire  Larger particle tend to travel small distances Smaller particles can travel much longer distances Some plants may be easier/harder to identify than others   Pollen analysis can give you knowledge on what (wind pollinated) plants were common at the time in that area  Provides broad perspective of vegetation over time Pollen can travel far, so resolution isn\u0026rsquo;t great   Phytoliths  Tiny particles formed in many plants They don\u0026rsquo;t break down \u0026ndash; can stay in soil for hundreds to thousands of years! Can be used to identify plant species Cons: Not all plants produce them; overrepresented in grasses      2. Coring Trees #    You basically jab a metal straw into a tree and get a sample of the tree  Doesn\u0026rsquo;t harm tree, tree naturally patches the hole itself   These sample contain rings Give us age and growth rate of the tree  Growth increase in rings can allude to neighboring trees being killed Dead neighboring trees means less canopy blocking sunshine and less trees competing for nutrients   Multiple samples can give us an overview of a landscape  Do we see a multi-age forest? Do we see synchrony in growth rate?   Crossdating: To identify events, we compare the sample\u0026rsquo;s tree rings to those of other \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; trees in different areas at the same time    Note that the example above is a rare occurrence  3. Fire Scars #    Fire scars occur when fire kills part of the cambium below bark, leaving a wound  The scar itself takes ~10 years to show up   Multiple dated wounds allude to multiple fire occurrences You can also get the seasonality too  Spring trees have warmer water so the scars are lighter in color Fall/winter trees have slower cell movement, so the scars are darker (this is called \u0026ldquo;latewood\u0026rdquo;) Therefore, how deep the scar is in the wood corresponds to the season the fire occurred   Use crossdating for high accuracy and precision Pines, White oaks, Sequoia, Redwood, Incense, and Cedars are all good trees to take samples from Wedges:  You can take wedges from the tree to get access to the ring view Both living and dead wood samples can be dated Pines, redwood, cedar, giant sequoia are all rot resistant thus good species to sample You ideally want to cut a thin wedge that has a large surface area and includes center of tree   Downsides  Trees heal covering up scars or scars are in an exposed cavity that can be seen Problem when fire interval \u0026lt; 10 years (such as cultural burnings)  Most of the time fires aren\u0026rsquo;t severe enough to scare deeply enough and if they do scar, it\u0026rsquo;s feint Only 5% of trees sampled scarred in Sierra Nevada   Fire scars have a finite lifespan (tree lifespan) Paints picture only of a certain plant in the landscape    Fire History Study Sierra Nevada #   Two large sampling areas, one north and south Sierra Nevada Systematic fire history sample in mixed conifer forests Important confluence of at least 3 Tribes: Sierra Miwok, Yokut, and Western Mono.  Burned extensively for multiple objectives This periodic burning limited severity of fires   Fire area did not exceed 1500 ha in any year.  Approximately 50% of area This is tiny compared to the scale of other fires in California!    Area burned in California #   Before 1800  Lightning fire Indian burning  Burned most of grasslands, wetlands, oak woodlands, some forests   4.5 million acres/yr. burned    Costal California Today #   Large area: scotia to Morro bay Very diverse vegetation type  From mixed conifer to costal prairie Fire regimes depend on vegetation, thus they\u0026rsquo;re diverse Likewise, some regions don\u0026rsquo;t consider burning at all and only do suppression whereas others use burnings frequently   General ignition sources  At higher mountains, lighting ignition occurs (still rare, however) At lower elevations / costal areas, human ignition is the main sources  Looking at history, we see that Indian fires dominated for thousands of years     Sudden oak death (SOD) in Tanoak Forest  Invasive pathogen in Marin Country Dead trees increase the severity of fires   Prescribed fire periods  Done in fall if not drying to damage trees  Trees are in dormant phase, less damaging   Done in spring if trying to control/limit  Wet spring conditions are easier to manage      Location Types #   Costal Prairie  Interval: Short  Frequent fires critical to killing shrubs/trees Therefore, due to human intervention douglas-fir and shrublands have began to take over prairies   Source: Indian Type: high \u0026ndash;

Mediterranean Climate is Fire Enabler  Wet cool winters lead to high plant production Dry and drought-ful summers provide a dry, extensive fuel base   Native Californians realized that fire was a natural occurrence and learned to live with fire Reasoning for Cultural Burnings (Landscape scale)  Fires Control Insects/Pests Remove Detritus, clean-up landscape Open Pathways Use Fire to Hunt Game (driving animals into traps/valleys) and Insects Produce Straight Stems for cordage, baskets Augment Growth/Diversity of Plants and Animals in Territory Increases productivity of nutrient rich plants that animals eat  Deer heard sizes are correlated with burnings   Stimulate Growth of broad spectrum of economic resources  Through burning in Patchy Mosaics     How Areas Were Burned  Instigate fire regimes with frequent, small, low-intensity surface burns  Seasonality of burning very important to minimize risk of catastrophic fires Additionally, risk reduced by reduce fuel loads + creating fuel breaks   Burn to increase productivity and stimulate growth of broad spectrum of economic resources  Notably shrubs with berries, oak woodlands, coniferous   Intentionally create Patchy Mosaics  Increase quantity, diversity and sustainability of key plants and animals Different environments benefit from different style burnings resulting in checkerboard-esque patterns Used for foods, medicines, and raw materials Minimize risk of catastrophic fires due to reduced fuel loads and fire breaks   Burn areas contained by natural rivers/hills/ridges/basalt flows   Implications of Cultural Burning  Not Pristine Wilderness, but Managed Anthropogenic Landscape \u0026ndash; you have to take into account Indians when looking at CA\u0026rsquo;s landscape You can\u0026rsquo;t do restoration without bringing in people  Now, because of a lack of recent cultural burnings, some habitats are struggling        Controversy regarding cultural burnings #   Some argue that cultural fires were small in size, near villages, and had little impact on the larger ecosystem Rather, natural fires best explain these fires Evidence Types tend to be soft;  Tribal Oral Traditions have a Short Temporal Depth for cultural burnings  Observations limited primarily to last 250 years   Limitations arise when primarily referring to Ethnohistoric Sources  Ethnohistoric Studies are from (typically Spaniard around 1600-1700) explorers and not trained as anthropologists Accounts tend to be spotty, geographically biased, and not very detailed Sources don\u0026rsquo;t include key fire regime aspects (freq, seasonality, severity, area, synergy) Susceptible to biases, uncertainty, and anecdotes   Ethnographic Studies  Information is word of mouth history from within the tribe that\u0026rsquo;s passed from one generation to another Recorded by anthropologists Information is very brief/general and lacking in our definition of fire regime now Old archeologists may have viewed Indians as hunter/gatherers (which is wrong!) Colonizers prevented cultural fires (fire exclusion)  Fire exclusion is when fire is indirectly removed from the environment  E.x. adding livestock removes fuels, reducing/removing fire E.x. Colonizers removing Natives (for reasons other than their cultural burnings) removed fires, changing fire regime   Whereas fire suppression is mindful + target specifically at stopping fires  E.x. Using firetrucks, airplanes, etc. to stop a fire from spreading E.x laws preventing you from creating fires during the dry season     Thus, when we started Ethnographic studies in 1901(ish), we didn\u0026rsquo;t see the history before because current tribes weren\u0026rsquo;t allowed to perform cultural burnings     Instead, critics would like to see hard ecological data (fire scars, pollen analysis, charcoal accumulation, phytoliths) Two main reasons to address these criticisms  Differential impacts due to colonialism in different spaces and at different times  Some areas colonized much earlier than others in the state  Central and Souther coast colonized 2.5 centuries ago by Spaniards Others only were colonized during the gold rush)   Some tribes subjected to Fire Exclusion/Suppression policies  Lacking specific information about when these policies were enacted Tribes colonized during gold rush tend to have more information than those colonized earlier in time   Consequently, some tribes have not been able to practice Cultural burning for generations   Political Implications  Some scholars argue that there is no real evidence that Native people were good stewards of the land  Point to times when animals/plants went extinct   Consequently, they should not play a special role in decision making Ecological restoration projects today  Nor play much of a role in the management of our public Lands today        Eco-archaeological Research #   Eco-archaeological Research: When we bridge ecological studies with anthropological / archeological studies and native Oral traditions Tries to tackle Major Challenge of Eco-Archaeological Research: Differentiating Natural Fire Regimes from Anthropogenic Fire Regimes  Compare Expected Fire Regime from Lightning Strikes with Observed Fire Regime Based on multiple lines of evidence         Long-Term Diachronic Approach that Employ Multiple Lines of Evidence:  Native Oral Histories/Traditions Ethnohistorical Accounts Ethnographic Studies Ecological Studies of Fire Archaeological Research  Other methods   Involves Researching with Tribes  Two Case Studies #  1.

Colonization of California #  Introduction #   Maritime Exploration  The first real instance of Colonization Happened from 1542-1603 then a long break   Spanish Missions, Presidios (forts), Pueblos (civilian settlements)  Happened from 1769-1823 Primary goal was to Christianize and Civilize Created large farm areas Recruited thousands of Natives as labourers Select locations where existing towns had reduction policies  Reduction policies moved natives into a single village after their land was taken     Mexican Missions, Ranchos  When Mexico took over CA Happened from 1822-1846 Established huge, private ranches (Ranchos)  Ran by natives Generated lots of money     Colony Ross  Russian Colonization from 1812-1841 Carried out by Russian American Company  Hunted sea otters Sold pelts to China   Recruit Native Alaskans who served as primary hunters    Impact #   Native population declines  Many deaths due to diseases (some of which hit instantly, some which took time) Violence and warfare between natives and soldiers (Sexual) Abuse of young women   Unleashing of Foreign Weeds, Pests (Crosby 2004)  Raised range of new foods on large ranches Thousands of cattle changed landscape too by overgrazing Weeds spread aggressively at expense of indigenous plants Land remains changed even today (90% of biomass in grasslands today isn\u0026rsquo;t native) Archaeological Evidence of Spread of Weeds Mission excavations and adobe (mud) bricks   Grazing Economy (Dart-Newton, Erlandson 2006)  Free-Range Grazing (no fences) In addition to cattle, brought Sheep, Goats, Horses, and Pigs  Wild pigs are still an issue today   Major impacts to local environments and Native Foods  Overgrazing trample indigenous Ecological habitats Help spread weeds     Commercial Hunting of Mammals  Terrestrial Fur Trade  Primarily hunted beaver  Pelt used to make hats in Europe   Exterminate beavers from Western North America, Northern California Major Impacts for wetland habitats   Maritime Fur Trade (Colony Ross)  Use Native Alaskan Hunters Very Efficient Harvest primarily Sea Otters  Nearly eliminated, otter population still low population today   Major Changes to Kelp Forests which impacted Fisheries of California     Fire Exclusion (Timbrook)  Began in 1793 when the Governor prohibited burning from Natives Explicit Policies Enacted to Stop Native Peoples from Cultural Burning Affected both Native Neophytes and so Called Gentile Indians (not part of missions)    Implications #   Loss of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)  Amah Mutsun Tribal Band (Lopez 2013)  Could not conduct ceremonies, prayer songs Could not Steward the land Unable to pass information to next generation (loss of TEK) Willing to work with archaeologists, fire ecologists \u0026ndash; bring knowledge out of dormancy  Working to Restore Landscape Today     Chumash People (Timbrook et al 1993)  Located around Santa Barbara Ethnohistoric accounts of Native Burning, but largely faded from tribal memory when ethnographic research conducted in 1920-1930s     Significant Impact to Local Coastal Environments  Increase of Foreign Plants and Animals Decline in Diversity and Quantity of Indigenous Flora and Fauna Decreases Loss of Food Security, Food Sovereignty, Native Medicine, Raw Material, etc. for Natives   Many Coastal Tribes Displaced  Colonial Invaders take away Native land Especially costal land   Major Transformation in California Fire Regimes  Cultural Burning on Coast Stopped  Coastal Prairies get overrun by woody vegetation quickly Even if grazing kept off shrubs, new grasses would begin growing   Some Disturbance keep areas open: Grazing, Colonial Burning? Altered Fire Regimes due to new plant types    "},{"id":12,"href":"/docs/math-53/","title":"Math 53","section":"Docs","content":"Chapters #   10: Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates 12: Vectors and Geometry of Space 13: Vector Functions 14: Partial Derivatives  "},{"id":13,"href":"/docs/physics-7b/","title":"Physics 7B","section":"Docs","content":"Chapters #   17: Temperature, Thermal Expansion, \u0026amp; Ideal Gas Law 18: Kinetic Theory of Gases 19: Heat \u0026amp; First Law of Thermo 20: Second Law of Thermo 21: Electric Charges \u0026amp; Fields  "}]
