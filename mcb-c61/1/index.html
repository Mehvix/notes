Fossil fuel</li><li>Complete combustion will break all of the carbon-carbon and carbon &ndash; -hydrogen bonds and convert the hydrocarbon into a mixture of carbon dioxide (CO) and water.</li></ul></li><li>Carbon, as well as some other atoms, also has the capacity to participate in bonds with other atoms in which it shares more than one electron<ul><li>For example, in the ethylene molecule each carbon contributes two (rather than one) electrons to the carbon-carbon bond, forming what is called a double bond, drawn with a double line connecting the atoms.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=/docs/mcb-c61/31-4.png alt></p><ul><li>Ethylene is also a combustible gas, often used in welding<ul><li>However, the most widespread use of ethylene is to make polyethylene plastics by linking many ethylene molecules together in very long chains (polymers) of various shapes and forms.</li></ul></li><li>The arrangement of carbons in a hydrocarbon molecule is not always linear<ul><li>The chains of carbons may be branched, such as in this branched octane molecule.

The existence of such a combination of six carbons and six hydrogens was puzzling until Friedrich Kekulé (1829-1896) suggested a novel structure in 1865 for benzene.</li></ul></li><li>It is now appreciated that, rather than an alteration of single and double bonds, all the carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are equivalent and are sort of intermediate between single and double bonds in strength<ul><li>The shared electrons are best described as existing in molecular orbitals that encompass the entire ring structure</li><li>To represent this, the structural diagram for benzene is sometimes drawn witha circle inside the hexagon of carbons</li><li>While benzene itself does not occur in living organisms (it is a highly toxic and combustible liquid), the ring structure of benzene does occur widely as part of larger structures of many biological molecules</li><li>Let’s look at several of these that have relevance to the human nervous system.

<img src=/docs/mcb-c61/31-8.png alt></li></ul></li><li>Notice that within the diagrams for these molecules the benzene ring structure occurs<ul><li>Also notice that each of these molecules consists of a bunch of carbon atoms, several nitrogen and oxygen atoms, and a bunch of hydrogen atoms around the periphery of the molecule, all joined by chemical bonds so that a particular geometric shape results</li><li>Thus, these molecules are appreciated to be just a bunch of atoms (mostly carbon and hydrogen) connected together by the sharing of electrons (covalent chemical bonds) to form a particular geometric shape</li><li>It is their unique shapes that determine the properties of particular molecules within, say, the human nervous system.</li></ul></li><li>If you spend time drawing a few molecular structures like those of dopamine and serotonin, you very quickly appreciate that mostly what you are doing is drawing lots of Cs (representing carbon atoms) and Hs (representing hydrogen atoms).<ul><li>There may be a few other atoms, like the several oxygen and nitrogen atoms in dopamine and serotonin, but mostly there are Cs and Hs, lots and lots of Cs and Hs.</li><li>There can be so many Cs and Hs that it becomes difficult to notice the most important things about the molecule, such as the overall shape and what kinds of other atoms are part of the structure</li><li>Thus, chemists have developed a shorthand language for depicting the structures of organic molecules</li><li>In this shorthand language, the structures of dopamine and serotonin look like this:
<img src=/docs/mcb-c61/31-9.png alt></li><li>Here we are simply not drawing the Cs and most of the Hs. We are drawing only the bonds connecting the various atoms together.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Although the six carbon atoms in a benzene-ring structure are diagrammed with alternating single and double bonds, the shared electrons are best described as existing in molecular orbitals that encompass the entire ring structure.
<img src=/docs/mcb-c61/dop.png alt></p></blockquote></li><li>So now, at last, we can articulate the rules for drawing and interpreting molecular structure diagrams<ul><li>Covalent bonds are drawn as lines</li><li>If there is no letter explicitly shown at the end of a line, then it is assumed there is a carbon atom in that location</li><li>Thus, each line (bond) has a carbon atom at either end, unless another atom is explicitly drawn</li><li>Atoms other than carbon are indicated: N for nitrogen, O for oxygen, P for phosphorus, F for fluorine, and so forth</li><li>What about the hydrogen atoms</li><li>Because we know that carbon forms four bonds, any bonds not shown explicitly are assumed to be with hydrogen, enough hydrogens so that the total number of bonds per carbon equals four</li><li>Hydrogen atoms forming bonds with other elements (such as nitrogen and oxygen) are explicitly drawn in.</li></ul></li><li>One of the things we can easily do with this shorthand notation for molecular structure is compare similarities in shape between molecules<ul><li>For example, one can see that these molecules &ndash; dopamine and norepinephrine, which are neurotransmitters; amphetamine, methamphetamine, and ephedrine, which are psychoactive drugs; and phenylalanine, an amino acid &ndash; all share a basic similarity of shape, something about their gestalt, or form.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=/docs/mcb-c61/31-10.png alt></p><ul><li><p>In fact, they can all be chemically converted from one to another in straightforward ways, given the (R) conditions</p><ul><li>And because of their similar molecular shapes, there are connections between what these molecules do in living organisms.</li></ul></li><li><p>The three molecules below &ndash; tryptophan, an amino acid; serotonin, a neurotransmitter; and psilocin, a psychoactive molecule from <strong>Psilocybe</strong> mushrooms &ndash; all look somewhat similar to one another and different from the molecules pictured above.
<img src=/docs/mcb-c61/31-11.png alt></p></li><li><p>Finally, here is another famous molecule &ndash; caffeine.
<img src=/docs/mcb-c61/31-12.png alt></p></li><li><p>One sees that it, too, is simply a combination of rings of carbon and nitrogen atoms, together with a couple of oxygen atoms, but witha distinctly different shape compared with the other molecules drawn above</p><ul><li>Again, these differences in shape determine the different functions these molecules have in living organisms.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><ul><li>Returning to water, a key reason that water is so important in living systems is that it is so very effective at dissolving things<ul><li>Why is this so</li><li>The answer lies in a property of water known as polarity</li><li>In the water molecule (H$_2$O), the hydrogen atoms, being from the (L) side of the periodic table, are prone to giving up their electron and becoming positively charged</li><li>The oxygen, being from the (R) side of the periodic table, is prone to picking up electrons and becoming negatively charged</li><li>The result of these tendencies is that when the electrons forming the covalent bonds in water are distributed in the molecular orbitals describing the bonds, they essentially spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen and less time in the vicinity of the hydrogens.</li><li>So the oxygen atom in water becomes slightly negatively charged and the hydrogen atoms in water become slightly positively charged<ul><li>This is what is meant by polarity</li><li>Polar means separation, and in this case there is a separation of charge between different parts of the water molecule</li><li>Water is a polar molecule.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Water’s polarity causes the molecules to loosely stick to one another, a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding &ndash; the slightly negative oxygen atom of one water molecule is attracted to the slightly positive hydrogen atom of another (Opposite electric charges are attracted to one another.)<ul><li>This results in a matrix of water molecules held together in a loose way by hydrogen bonds, depicted here as dashed lines.
<img src=/docs/mcb-c61/31-13.png alt></li></ul></li><li>Hydrogen bonding is <strong>noncovalent</strong> &ndash; it does not involve sharing of electrons<ul><li>The water molecules are able to easily slip and slide past one another, producing the wateriness of liquid water</li><li>When water is heated the energy of the heat causes the molecules to jitter and shake more vigorously</li><li>At the boiling point, the jittering becomes vigorous enough to overcome the hydrogen bonding between water molecules, and the H$_2$O molecules escape as gaseous water &ndash; steam</li><li>Cool the water, and the molecular vibration lessens until, at the freezing point, the water molecules lock into a rigid matrix interconnected by hydrogen bonds &ndash; ice</li><li>The slight expansion of water when it freezes is due to the rigid matrix of hydrogen bonds taking slightly more space than when the molecules of water can slip and slide past one another in their liquid state.</li></ul></li><li>The polarity of water also accounts for water’s amazing ability to dissolve many things, including ions<ul><li>This can be illustrated by considering what is called table salt, sodium chloride (NaCl). A sodium atom (Na), being from the (L) side of the periodic table, very readily gives up an electron to form a positively charged sodium cation (Na).</li><li>A chlorine atom, being from the right side of the periodic table, will very readily take on an electron to form a negatively charged chloride anion (CI). Crystalline table salt, sodium chloride, can be described as an array of alternating sodium and chloride ions, held together by the electrical attraction of their respective positive and negative charges.</li><li>In the absence of water, NaCl is an extremely stable structure<ul><li>However, introduce even a small amount of water and the NaCl will begin to dissolve, that is, fall apart into the water.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>This illustrates water’s extraordinary ability to dissolve ions.<ul><li>Because the charged ions are attracted to the opposite-charged portions of the polar water molecule, water molecules can slip into the otherwise very stable matrix of sodium and chloride forming the salt crystal</li><li>As the salt crystal dissolves, the cations and anions become surrounded with polar water molecules, attracted to the ionic charges</li><li>A saltwater solution is formed</li><li>Water is very effective at dissolving all kinds of atoms and molecules that have a net electrical charge (such as ions) or, indeed, any polar molecule, because the positive and negative separation of charge in a polar molecule will be attracted to the positive and negative separation of charge in the water molecule.</li></ul></li><li>This allows us to introduce a very important concept into our description of solubility<ul><li>Water, a polar molecule, dissolves (or loves to hang out with) other things that have polarity or charge</li><li>We call things that like to hang out with water hydrophilic (Greek hydro = water, philos = loving). Hydrophilic substances like to be around water, and water likes to be around them</li><li>At the other extreme of solubility in water, consider the hydrocarbons</li><li>These molecules consist only of carbons and hydrogens linked by covalent bonds</li><li>When electrons are shared among carbon and hydrogen atoms, the electrons are essentially equally likely to be found in proximity to either type of atom</li><li>Thus, there is no significant polarity, or separation of charge, in a hydrocarbon molecule and so nothing with which a water molecule can form a hydrogen bond</li><li>Thus, hydrocarbons don’t dissolve in water</li><li>This is illustrated by the well-known adage that oil and water don’t mix</li><li>Substances such as hydrocarbons that don’t dissolve in water &ndash; that don’t like to hang out with water &ndash; are called hydrophobic (Greek phobos = fearing). Hydrophilic things like to hang out with other hydrophilic things, and hydrophobic things like to hang out with other hydrophobic things.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 id=4-fundamental-biological-molecules>4 Fundamental Biological Molecules
