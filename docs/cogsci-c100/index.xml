Boredom makes you feel sleepy, even if you have had enough sleep. Resting in bed with your eyes closed cannot satisfy your body’s need for sleep. Snoring is not harmful as long as it doesn’t disturb others. Everyone dreams nightly. Raising the volume of your radio will help you stay awake while driving. Sleep disorders are mainly due to worry or psychological problems.</description></item><item><title>6: Consciousness</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/cogsci-c100/consciousness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/cogsci-c100/consciousness/</guid><description>The mind-brain problem: What is mind? # The nature of the mind-body or mind-brain connection was a philosophical question of importance in the early days of cognitive science What is mind?

In analog code (i.e., as a pictorial representation) OR As a propositional code (i.e., descriptive representation)? Mental imagery # How Are Mental Representations Stored? # Experiments on mental imagery by Roger Shepard and Jacqueline Metzler in early 1970s spawned the imagery debate Suggested that some types of cognitive information processing involve forms of representation that are very different from how information is represented in, and manipulated by, a digital computer Imagery and rotation studies: Rotate each object on the left to see if it matches the object on the right: Amount of time it takes to rotate a mental image depends on the extent of the rotation One feature of digitally encoded information is that the length of time it takes to process a piece of information is typically a function only of the quantity of information (the number of bits that are required to encode it)</description></item><item><title>13: Language</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/cogsci-c100/language/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/cogsci-c100/language/</guid><description>Controversies in Cognitive Science # How is language acquired and how do we process words when reading?
