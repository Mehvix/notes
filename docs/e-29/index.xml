The class is made up of 9 modules:
Fundamentals Subtractive manufacturing processes Additive manufacturing processes Forming processes Joining processes Graphical visualization techniques Metrology: measuring manufactured objects Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing The future of manufacturing Why manufacturing? # In 2018, U.</description></item><item><title>Week 1: Fundamentals of Graphical Communication &amp; Subtractive Processes</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/e-29/1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/e-29/1/</guid><description>1-25: Fundamentals of graphical communication # These are notes are also on notes.mehvix.com/e-29/1/
Evolution of graphical visualization # Hand drawing Instrument drawing (using mechanical things to measure distances) 2D CAD (initially only able to draw side views) 3D CAD (solid modeling) Automatic generation of 2D working drawings Enable easy communication of measurements between designer and manufacturer Created with the assumption that manufactured objects are made up of elementary objects, geons?</description></item><item><title>Week 2: Cutting-based Processes &amp; Other Subtractive Processes:</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/e-29/2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/e-29/2/</guid><description>Modeling of material cutting # Lathe operations Turning on a lathe Nomenclature of cutting process # Merchantâ€™s circle: cutting forces # Force diagram that resolves the reaction force exerted by the tool on the work Relating cutting geometry to cutting forces Material properties link the geometry of the tool and cutting path to the forces involved. The material being cut needs to exceed its shear yield stress to start deforming (cutting) and creating a chip.</description></item></channel></rss>
