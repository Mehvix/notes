The class is made up of 9 modules:
Fundamentals Subtractive manufacturing processes Additive manufacturing processes Forming processes Joining processes Graphical visualization techniques Metrology: measuring manufactured objects Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing The future of manufacturing Why manufacturing? # In 2018, U.</description></item><item><title>Week 1</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/e-29/1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/e-29/1/</guid><description>1-25: Fundamentals of graphical communication # Evolution of graphical visualization # Hand drawing Instrument drawing (using mechanical things to measure distances) 2D CAD (initially only able to draw side views) 3D CAD (solid modeling) Automatic generation of 2D working drawings Enable easy communication of measurements between designer and manufacturer Created with the assumption that manufactured objects are made up of elementary objects, geons? Now we have the ability to run algos to analyze models, removing unnecessary bits We&amp;rsquo;re moving towards computer-generated geometry that&amp;rsquo;s contained by human input # Increasingly complex geometries Topological optimization Internal lattices The way we interface with drawings has to keep up with this New interfaces Virtual and augmented reality for visualizing designs Why bother sketching by hand?</description></item></channel></rss>
