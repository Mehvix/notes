      <description>Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates: #  10.1 Curves Defined by Parametric Equations #   Parametric equations are written as .$(f(t), g(t))$ They define curves (not functions!) Time  $$t \in [t_i, t_f] $$ Initial point: .$(f(t_i), g(t_i))$ Terminal point: .$(f(t_f), g(t_f))$   For parametric equation in form .$(h + r \cdot \sin(t), k + r \cdot \cos(t))$ on .$t \in [0, 2\pi]$ , the resulting curve is a circle clockwise centered around the point .</description>

      <description>Temperature, Thermal Expansion, &amp;amp; Ideal Gas Law #  17.1: Atomic Theory (pg 475) #   Atoms are the smallest unit of matter Atomic unit: .$u = 1.66^{-27}$ kg  E.x. Hydrogen weighs .$1.0078 ua$   Molecular mass of a compound is the sum of the particles (atoms) in the compound  Terms #   Element: Substance that cannot be broken down into smaller substances (gold) Molecule: Group of atoms held together by covalent bonds Compound: Substance made from atoms combined in specific ratios  Brownian Motion #   Random movement seen in pollen/dust, as well as atoms Using Brownian motion, Einstein found the size of an atom to be .</description>
