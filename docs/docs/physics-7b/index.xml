      <description>17.1: Atomic Theory (pg 475) #   Atoms are the smallest unit of matter Atomic unit: .$u = 1.66^{-27}$ kg  E.x. Hydrogen weighs .$1.0078 ua$   Molecular mass of a compound is the sum of the particles (atoms) in the compound  Terms #   Element: Substance that cannot be broken down into smaller substances (gold) Molecule: Group of atoms held together by covalent bonds Compound: Substance made from atoms combined in specific ratios  Brownian Motion #   Random movement seen in pollen/dust, as well as atoms Using Brownian motion, Einstein found the size of an atom to be .</description>

      <description>19.1 Heat as Energy Transfer #  Units #   Heat unit is calorie (cal)  The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 celsius $$4.186 \text{ J} = 1 \text{ cal}$$   Kilocalorie (kcal, Calorie) is more common  Amount of heat needed to raise 1 kg of water by 1 celsius $$4.186 \text{ kJ} = 1 \text{ kcal}$$   British system of units has British thermal units (Btu)  One Btu is the heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 lb of water by 1 Fahrenheit $$1 \text{ Btu} = 0.</description>
