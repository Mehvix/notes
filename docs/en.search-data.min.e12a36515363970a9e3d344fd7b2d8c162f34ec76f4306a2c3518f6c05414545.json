(b) An expanded portion of the diagram for low temperatures, where the phase can change from a gas to a liquid.\n  At high enough pressures, gases take up less volume than expected.  This effect is magnified with lower temperatures   At lower temperatures, the .$PE$ attractive forces between particles aren\u0026rsquo;t negligible with respect to .$KE$ At the critical points, (when .$PV$ curve is horizontal) gases may no longer change to liquid under any pressure  This point varies by substance Gas below the critical point is vapor Gas above the critical point is just gas /shrug   Sublimation: When substance changes from solid to gas, skipping liquefaction step  18.4 Vapor, Pressure, and Humidity #  Evaporation #   Molecules in liquid are held tightly together with intermolecular attractive forces (covalent hydrogen bonds) Some molecules may momentarily leave the liquid if their velocity is fast enough  If velocity isn\u0026rsquo;t too large, then the particle will be pulled back to the liquid surface If velocity is large enough, then the particle will break the intermolecular bonds leave the liquid and enter gas form  low probability     Because .$v_{\\text{particle}} \\propto T$, the .$\\text{evaporation rate} \\propto T$ As fast moving (thus hot) particles leave the liquid, the liquid\u0026rsquo;s temperature decreases  That is, evaporation is a cooling process    Vapor Pressure #    When evaporation particles go from gas to liquid, it\u0026rsquo;s called condensation The number of particles in vapor increases until the rate of particles condensing is equal to the number of particles becoming vapor (equilibrium!)  When this state is reached, the space above the water is considered saturated Pressure of vapor saturation is called (saturated) vapor pressure   Saturated Vapor Pressure varies with the volume of container  If volume above the liquid was reduced, then the density would increase so particles would condense back to liquid Assuming .$T = \\text{constant}$, vapor pressure would stay constant too   Since at high temperatures there are more particles (entering/already in) the vapor phase, higher pressure is required for equilibrium When the volume is large, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that all the liquid evaporates before equilibrium  Boiling #   Boiling occurs when saturated vapor pressure equals external pressure Bubbling forms as temperature approaches boiling temperature  If the pressure in the bubbles are less than the external pressure, the bubbles are crushed Otherwise, bubbles are able to rise to surface   Boiling point is proportional to pressure  Lower pressure = lower temperature required for boiling point    Partial Pressure and Humidity #   In gases composed of multiple other gases, the total pressure is the sum of all partial pressures for each of other sub gas Partial Pressure is the pressure a single gas would exert by itself  The partial pressure of water in the air can be as low as zero and vary up to a maximum equal to the saturated vapor pressure (of water at the given temperature)   Relative Humidity: ratio of partial pressure of water vapor to the saturated vapor pressure at a given temperature $$\\text{Relative Humidity} = \\frac{\\text{partial pressure of }H_2O}{\\text{saturated vapor pressure of }H_2O} \\cdot 100\\%$$ Super Saturation: .$P_{\\text{partial}} \u0026gt; P_{\\text{saturated vapor pressure}}$  Happens when temperature decreases Excess water condenses as dew / mist    18.5 Van der Waals Equation of State #  Microscopic View (molecular) accounts for\n Finite size of molecules (before we assumed separation .$\\gg$ diameter, ignoring density)  Since gas particles aren\u0026rsquo;t negligible in size, we can\u0026rsquo;t use all of our volume Particles are solid spheres that can\u0026rsquo;t get closer than .$2r$ to one another  That means .$V$ is over-estimated: .$V_{\\text{real}} \u0026lt; V_{\\text{ideal}}$ Lower volume mean more collisions, leading to pressure being higher than estimated with the ideal gas law: .$P_{\\text{real}} \u0026gt; P_{\\text{ideal}}$   The unavailable volume due to particles, .$b$, depends on the .$n$umber of moles $$ P(V-nb) = nRT \\to P\\bigg(\\frac{V}{n} - b\\bigg) = RT\\ \\ \\ \\big[\\text{Clausius Equation of State}\\big]$$   Forces between molecules (before we assumed that forces only played an effect in collisions)  At low .$T$, electric attractive forces aren\u0026rsquo;t 0  Particles towards the edge are slowed down by the other particles attractive forces For that reason, our pressure is lower than estimated with the ideal gas law: .$P_{\\text{real}} \u0026lt; P_{\\text{ideal}}$   \u0026ldquo;Slow down\u0026rdquo; is proportional to the gas density Pressure reduced by the following equation where .$n/V$ is the gas density and .$a$ is a constant unique to the gas $$ a\\bigg( \\frac{n}{V}\\bigg)^2$$      Thus, we can rewrite the ideal gas law with the last two equations as $$ \\bigg(P+ \\frac{a}{(V/n)^2}\\bigg)\\bigg(\\frac{V}{n} - b\\bigg) = RT \\ \\ \\big[\\text{Van der Waals Eq of State}\\big]$$\n  Note that these equations aren\u0026rsquo;t accurate in all cases, but they\u0026rsquo;re the best generalization we can do and they show the relation\n  With low densities, .$a\\big/(V/n)^2 \\ll P$ and .$b \\ll V/n$ so Van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law\n  18.6 Mean Free Path #   Molecules bump into each other a lot which slow them down Mean free path: Average distance between collisions is proportional to .$\\rho ^{-1}, r^{-1}$ $$l_m = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\sqrt{2}r^2 (N/V)}$$  18.7 Diffusion #   Particles diffuse from high to low concentrations until equilibrium is reached (when .$\\rho$ is constant throughout) Given a tube with a cross section area .$A$, two concentrations, .$C_1$ and .$C_2$, separated by .$\\Delta x$, we can write the rate of diffusion, .$J$, as $$J = DA \\frac{C_1 - C_2}{\\Delta x} = DA \\frac{dC}{dx} \\ \\ \\text{[Fick\u0026rsquo;s Law]}$$ .$D$ is the diffusion constant  Varies with temperature, viscosity, and particle size    "},{"id":5,"href":"/physics-7b/19/","title":"19: Heat and the First Law of Thermo","section":"Physics 7B","content":"19.1 Heat as Energy Transfer #  Units #   Heat unit is calorie (cal)  The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 celsius $$4.186 \\text{ J} = 1 \\text{ cal}$$   Kilocalorie (kcal, Calorie) is more common  Amount of heat needed to raise 1 kg of water by 1 celsius $$4.186 \\text{ kJ} = 1 \\text{ kcal}$$   British system of units has British thermal units (Btu)  One Btu is the heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 lb of water by 1 Fahrenheit $$1 \\text{ Btu} = 0.252 \\text{ kcal} = 1056 \\text{ J}$$ Gas companies use the unit therm: .$10^5 \\text{ Btu}$    Heat #   Heat is energy transferred from one object to another because of a difference in temperature.

Natural Biospheric Fire \u0026ndash; Natural Fire Regime #   (Potential) start date for pyrogeography During Silurian and Devonian Periods (440-400 HYA) Natural fire regime started during this period because it was the first time that the fire triangle came together Fire triangle:  Ignition Source: (Since beginning) Natural ignition from lightening, volcanoes, (rarely) falling rock sparks  These natural sources tend to only begin fires in the dry season   Oxygen Source: (Cambrian period) Atmospheric Oxygen (from photosynthetic plants) leads to appearance of photosynthetic organisms Fuel Source: (Silurian and Devonian Periods) Enough terrestrial plants in ecosystems to acts as fuel   During this time, natural fire regimes evolved  As coal became more common (Carboniferous period), fires did too    2. Wildland Anthropogenic Fire \u0026ndash; Hunter/Gatherer Fire Regime #    When people began acting as the ignition source\n  Primarily used fire for domestic cases\n Heating, cooking, warmth, etc.    When people move to a new land\n Major changes in fauna, vegetation, and fires (charcoal) People seem to bring fire with them as they migrate    Start dates\n 40 ka for Australia  90% of fauna went extinct Lots of evidence of fire   45 ka for Highland New Guinea 50 ka for lowland Borneo 20 ka for the Americas  Extinctions of many animals and vegetation  Debate: are these because of natural process like climate change (ice age -\u0026gt; post ice age?) or do people play a large role   Native Perspective ‚Äì Indigenous people have been here since time began      When did humans actually discover fire? #   Defining the bridge between phase one and two is difficult Definition problems  Do we ask when did (modern humans / hominin ancestors) develop the ability to control and utilize fire? We also need to distinguish between (1) controlling / utilizing fire and (2) being able to start a fire on a whim   Archeological problems  Fire exists naturally, so we can\u0026rsquo;t assume all fire evidence is from human action Other natural processes can look like fire (e.g. staining by minerals in soil, oxidation causing reddish patches) Combustion of natural objects (e.g. bushes) can leave charcoal which looks like a human hearth  Additionally, evidence of a hearth doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that humans started/controlled fire     Archaeological Record Analysis  In the field:  Observation and collection of materials Study the geology of the site   In the lab:  Microscopic analysis to see if there was burning If so, could the location of the sample been transported after combustion? Further, how does the history of the burned object associate with cultural items      How long has fire been controlled? #   Europe: Strong evidence of 400,000 - 300,000 years ago Western Asia: One established case from 780,000 years ago. Other sites are similar to Europe Africa: Claims have been made for a cave site that shows fire around 1.5-1.6 million years ago Note that opportunistic use of fire could have happened much earlier  Eg. lighting a torch from a natural-starting forest fire    3. Agriculture Anthropogenic Fire \u0026ndash; Agricultural Fire Regime #   Required fire to alter the natural vegetation from perennial-dominated to annual-dominated landscapes. People preferred to live in fire-prone places because the burning provides advantages for hunting, foraging, cultivating, and livestock herding  4. Industrial and Domestic Anthropogenic Fire \u0026ndash; Industrial Fire Regime #   Low-severity surface fire regimes are being replaced with low-frequency, high-intensity crown fires that are outside the historical range of variability for these ecosystems Western US: forests have also experienced an increase in hazardous fuels due to highly effective fire suppression policy that excluded fires for much of the 20th century Eastern US: Fire suppression has shifted oak and pine woodlands to mesophytic hardwoods consequently reducing flammability and fire activity Globally: urban areas have steadily expanded into wildland areas  Producing more ignition sources (arson and accidental) Exposing more people to wildfire    Key Factors in Fire Regimes (Discussion 8-30) #   Frequency  The interval of fire occurrences E.x. every four years   Area  Size, distribution, location Ground fires (primarily dead plants) vs crown (burning upper canopy of living trees)  Crown fires areas are more difficult to manage because controlled burns still damage natural resources     Severity  How destructive a fire is Change in dominant species / change in ecosystem Quantifiable by how much soil on the ground is visible   Seasonality  How the season affects fires May or may not be annual May arise due to weather conditions Ex. Annual to decadal cycles of drying conditions   Interactions  General activity on the landscape leading to different fire outcomes Droughts leading to stress on fuels Beatles eating bark, making trees more vulnerable Fire suppression leading to less severe fires Climate change making fires more severe    Biodiversity and Fire as a Selective Variable in Evolution #   .$C_4$ grass  Spread during seasonal climate in the tertiary period (when fires became more common) Fires lead to woodlands and created environments favorable to .$C_4$ grasslands Since .$C_4$ is high flammability, it would have produced a feedback process that further increased fire activity,  Thus maintaining the grassland-dominated landscape This process is similar to the one currently maintaining many of our savannas     Plant attributes  Heat shock  Certain species have seeds that will open with heat Not exclusive to fire; correlated with soil heat too   Smoke  Highly selective and specific to fire Smoke is a mixture of specific chemicals unique to itself   Note that plants become resistant to certain fire regimes, not necessarily all  Changes in fire regime can kill off fire resistant plants     Even small differences in the deployment of fire outside of natural lightning strikes can alter patterns of forest succession, fuel availability, and seasonality of ignitions  Fires Relating to Evolution #   Beneficial Attributes  Cooking hypothesis  Key claim: Fire + cooking started with the Homo erectus. As such, humans have evolved around a cooked diet that they can\u0026rsquo;t live without Led to fitness advantage More energy + nutrient from food, enabling body and brain size increase Detoxing effect Increase digestibility of all food Cooking takes time, leading to social development  Distribution of tasks among group: (collection, preparation, even stealing)   Cooking accounts for reduction in jaw, tooth size (due to softer food), stomach, and digestive system size There is no evidence of modern human societies existing without cooked food Counterpoints:  It\u0026rsquo;s still unclear that Homo erectus controlled fire There are some sites that show no example of cooking: e.g. Neanderthal sites in cold climates Energetic effects aren\u0026rsquo;t well quantified Digestive evolution may not have been linear; other adaptations related to fire occurred after Homo erectus     Protection benefits at night (especially versus the alternative: sleeping in trees) Allowed much better vision in caves  Enables cave art   Evidence that some hominids could use fire to morph certain woods into tools (e.g. digging sticks, hafted spears) Allowed humans to colonize colder environments Increase prey abundances, maintain mosaic landscapes, and increase pyrodiversity and succession stage heterogeneity   Social bonding  Led to camp fires Allows people to stay up later Fire could be used as a story telling enhancer, means to pass on history, culture, etc. Provides a sense of intimacy and openness Opportunity for music    Fire-stick farming  clearing ground for human habitats facilitating travel killing vermin, hunting regenerating plant food sources for both humans and livestock warfare among tribes   Woody, closed-canopy shrublands were opened up or entirely displaced  Led to spread of fast-growing annual species that provided greater seed resources, travel, and hunting and planting opportunities Ex. CA land was only used for agriculture after burnings, which led to many other alien plants spreading too Reductions in arboreal cover and woody understory have the most potential to enhance erosion Reshaping of landscapes has posed problems for ecologists trying to understand contemporary landscape patterns    Overview of Fires in California #   Conflagrating California\n ~54% of CA ecosystems depend on fire The remaining ecosystems that aren\u0026rsquo;t too extreme for fires (so not deserts, stony summits, wetlands, etc.) are fire adapted  \u0026ldquo;Fire season is 13 months\u0026rdquo;\n  CA has a diverse ecosystem; each site is similar to another one elsewhere though What sets CA apart is the scale and intensity of it\u0026rsquo;s fires    CA\u0026rsquo;s fires are unique in that they lead national discourse Texas views the US as France views the EUnion \u0026ndash; a canvas to project it\u0026rsquo;s ideals Alaska view the US as a source of subsidies.
