The lower curves are not hyperbolas, because the gas is no longer an ideal gas. (b) An expanded portion of the diagram for low temperatures, where the phase can change from a gas to a liquid.\n  Phase changes can only be explained if we\u0026rsquo;re considering the behavior of a real \u0026ndash; not ideal \u0026ndash; gas  This is because phase changes involve intermolecular bonds which we only factor in when considering real gases   At high enough pressures, gases take up less volume than expected.  This effect is magnified with lower temperatures   At lower temperatures, the .$PE$ attractive forces between particles aren\u0026rsquo;t negligible with respect to .$KE$ At the critical points, (when .$PV$ curve is horizontal) gases may no longer change to liquid under any pressure  This point varies by substance Gas below the critical point is vapor Gas above the critical point is just gas /shrug   Sublimation: When substance changes from solid to gas, skipping liquefaction step  18.4 Vapor, Pressure, and Humidity #  Evaporation #   Molecules in liquid are held tightly together with intermolecular attractive forces (covalent hydrogen bonds) Some molecules may momentarily leave the liquid if their velocity is fast enough  If velocity isn\u0026rsquo;t too large, then the particle will be pulled back to the liquid surface If velocity is large enough, then the particle will break the intermolecular bonds and leave the liquid to enter their gas form  Low probability of occurring     Because .$v_{\\text{particle}} \\propto T$, the .$\\text{evaporation rate} \\propto T$ As fast moving (thus hot) particles leave the liquid, the liquid\u0026rsquo;s temperature decreases  That is, evaporation is a cooling process    Vapor Pressure #    A typical phase diagram.

When this state is reached, the space above the water is considered saturated Pressure of vapor saturation is called (saturated) vapor pressure   Saturated Vapor Pressure varies with the volume of container  If volume above the liquid was reduced, then the density would increase so particles would condense back to liquid Assuming .$T = \\text{constant}$, vapor pressure would stay constant too   Since at high temperatures there are more particles (entering/already in) the vapor phase, higher pressure is required for equilibrium When the volume is large, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that all the liquid evaporates before equilibrium  Boiling #   Boiling occurs when saturated vapor pressure equals external pressure Bubbling forms as temperature approaches boiling temperature  If the pressure in the bubbles are less than the external pressure, the bubbles are crushed Otherwise, bubbles are able to rise to surface   Boiling point is proportional to pressure  Lower pressure = lower temperature required for boiling point    Partial Pressure and Humidity #   In gases composed of multiple other gases, the total pressure is the sum of all partial pressures for each of other sub gas Partial Pressure is the pressure a single gas would exert by itself  The partial pressure of water in the air can be as low as zero and vary up to a maximum equal to the saturated vapor pressure (of water at the given temperature)   Relative Humidity: ratio of partial pressure of water vapor to the saturated vapor pressure at a given temperature $$\\text{Relative Humidity} = \\frac{\\text{partial pressure of }H_2O}{\\text{saturated vapor pressure of }H_2O} \\cdot 100\\%$$ Super Saturation: .$P_{\\text{partial}} \u0026gt;

V_{\\text{ideal}}$ Lower volume mean more collisions, leading to pressure being higher than estimated with the ideal gas law: .$P_{\\text{real}} \u0026gt; P_{\\text{ideal}}$   The unavailable volume due to particles, .$b$, depends on the .$n$umber of moles $$ P(V-nb) = nRT \\Longrightarrow P\\bigg(\\frac{V}{n} - b\\bigg) = RT\\ \\ \\ \\big[\\text{Clausius Equation of State}\\big]$$   Forces between molecules (before we assumed that forces only played an effect in collisions)  At low .$T$, electric attractive forces aren\u0026rsquo;t 0  Particles towards the edge are slowed down by the other particles attractive forces For that reason, our pressure is lower than estimated with the ideal gas law: .$P_{\\text{real}} \u0026lt;

A certain energy is required for a phase change During phase changes, temperature stops increasing and all energy goes into the phase change Latent heat is lost during phase change (often in the form of heat)      Heat of fusion  .$L_F$: Heat required to change .$1.0 \\text{ kg}$ of a substance from solid to liquid state Heat fusion of water is .$79.7 \\text{kcal/kg} = 333 \\text{kJ/kg}$   Heat of Vaporization  .$L_V$: Heat required to change a substance from liquid to vapor phase Heat vaporization is .$539 \\text{kcal/kg} = 2260 \\text{kJ/kg}$   Heat involved in the phase change depends on the mass and latent heat: $$\\Delta Q = mL$$ Therefore, when considering the change in a system involving heating a substance to a phase change (e.g. boiling at temperature .$T$), we can write: $$\\Delta Q_{\\text{total}} = mc \\Delta T + mL$$  Evaporation #   Heat of Vaporization of water increases slightly with a decrease in Temperature At .$20^\\circ \\text{ C}$, it\u0026rsquo;s .$585 \\text{ \\text{kcal/kg}}$ When liquid evaporates, the remaining liquid cools because the heat/energy comes from the water itself Therefore, internal energy decreases with evaporation  Kinetic Theory of Latent Heats #   At melting point, the latent heat of fusion doesn\u0026rsquo;t increase the average KE / temperature Rather, the energy goes into overcoming the PE associated with the forces between the molecules  Once the molecules in a solid are broken from there lattice formation, they can freely roll over one another as a liquid   More energy is required for liquid to gas phase because the average distance between the molecules is greatly increased  The larger the distance that the molecules have to be separated, the more work has to be done to pull them apart    19.6 First Law of Thermo #   Heat and work are different  Heat is the transfer of energy due to a difference in temperature \u0026ndash; hot/cold bath around gas chamber Work is the transfer of energy not due to a temperature difference \u0026ndash; piston applying force to a gas   Internal energy and temperature are both proportional to heat and work though with the following equation: $$\\Delta E_{\\text{int}} = Q - W = E_{\\text{int, 2}} - E_{\\text{int, 1}} \\ \\ \\ \\text{[First Law of Thermo.]}$$ .$Q$ is net heat added to the system  Heat added is .$\\texttt{+}$, heat lost is .$\\texttt{-}$, E.x. gas chamber heated .$\\Longrightarrow$ system gains energy   .$W$ is net work done by the system  Work done by system is .$\\texttt{+}$, work done on the system is .$\\texttt{-}$, E.x. gas expands .$\\Longrightarrow$ system looses energy   .$Q$ and .$W$ are not state variables in that a static state doesn\u0026rsquo;t have \u0026ldquo;heat\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; only when the system changes through thermodynamic process can we measure heat/work.  This is unlike .$P, V, T$ and .$E_{\\text{int}}$ which are **state variables** (can be measured at all states)   We can also extend the first law to include systems that have KE and PE: $$\\Delta K + \\Delta U + \\Delta E_{\\text{int}} = Q - W = E_{\\text{int, 2}} - E_{\\text{int, 1}}$$  19.7 Thermodynamic Process and the 1st Law #  Isothermal Process (.$\\Delta T = 0$) #    When temperature is constant, .$PV = \\text{constant}$ Each label of points in the graph above represent the systems states (it\u0026rsquo;s pressure and temperatures) Isotherms: curves in PV diagram  At a lower temperature, an isothermal process would be represented by the isotherm .$A\u0026rsquo;B'$   We also assume that the container is a heat reservoir: a body whose mass is so big that the temperature doesn\u0026rsquo;t change when heat is exchanged We increase internal energy by doing work, such as by decreasing the volume of the container with by applying a force to a piston over some distance  We assume that expansion/compression is  quasistatic: we decrease the volume slow enough that we can consider it a series of equilibrium states all at the same temperature   E.x. if we started with state .$A$ and added heat .$Q$ to the system, the system would reach point .$B$  If .$T$ remain constant, the volume will expand, both doing work .$W$ on the environment and decreasing the .$P$ We know .$E_\\text{int} = \\frac{3}{2}nR\\Delta T$, and since .$\\Delta T = 0 \\Longrightarrow E_\\text{int} = 0$ Thus, .$E_\\text{int} = Q - W \\Longrightarrow W = Q$    Adiabatic Process (.$Q = 0$) #    No heat allowed to flow in our out of system. This can happen if\u0026hellip;  Process happens so quickly that heat, a slow process, has no time to flow in/out  E.x. a combustion engine happens quickly it\u0026rsquo;s nearly adiabatic   System is well insulated   If a system experiences an adiabatic process slowly, it will look similar to curve .$AC$ Since .$Q = 0 \\Longrightarrow \\Delta E_\\text{int} = -W$ In a reverse processes represented by .$CA$ (adiabatic compression), work is done on the gas so .$E_\\text{int}$ and .$T$ rise  Isobaric and Isovolumetric #     Isobaric: .$\\Delta P = 0 \\Longrightarrow Q = \\Delta E_\\text{int} + W = \\Delta E_\\text{int} + P\\Delta V$. The heat transferred to the system does work, but also changes the internal energy of the system  Isovolumetric: .$\\Delta V = 0 \\Longrightarrow W = 0 \\Longrightarrow Q = \\Delta E_\\text{int}$. The thermodynamic process is the addition or removal of heat. First law of thermo holds for both of these processes  Work done in volume changes #   For quasistatic processes: $$dW = \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = PA d\\vec{l} = P\\ dV \\ \\ \\ \\text{(1)}$$ $$W = \\int dW = \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} P\\ dV \\ \\ \\ \\text{(2)}$$ .$\\text{(1)}$ Where .$F = PA$ is the force the gas exerts on the piston and .$d\\vec{l}$ is the (small) distance the piston moves .$\\text{(2)}$ This shows that the work done is the area under the .$PV$ curve  This equations are valid for work done in any volume change (solid, liquids, gas)   .$W$ (and even .$Q$) depends on the initial and final states and also on the process (or path)  Isothermal #   $$W = \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} P \\ dV$$ $$... = nRT \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} \\frac{dV}{V}$$ $$... = nRT \\ln{\\frac{V_B}{V_A}}$$     Isovol. and Isobaric #   $$W_{\\text{Isovol.}} = 0$$ $$W_{\\text{Isobaric}} = \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} P \\ dV$$ $$\u0026hellip; = P \\Delta V$$ $$\u0026hellip; = P_B(V_B - V_A)$$ $$\u0026hellip; = = nRT_B(1 - \\frac{V_A}{V_B})$$     Free Expansion #   A type of adiabatic process where gas is allowed to expand in a volume without doing any work Must be done with insulated containers so that no heat is able to flow in/out; .$Q = 0$ No work is done either because no object is moved; .$W = 0$ Thus, .$\\Delta E_\\text{int} = 0$ In reality, we see temperature slightly drops meaning internal energy does depend on pressure or volume as well as temperature.  19.8 Molar Specific Heats for Gases and Equipartition of Energy #  Molar Specific Heat #   Specific heat for gases depends heavily on the process and how it\u0026rsquo;s carried out Specific heat for constant pressure and constant volume vary We use molar specific heat for gases: .$C_V$ and .$C_P$ which are defined as the heat required to raise .$1 \\text{ mol}$ of gas by .$1^\\circ \\text{ C}$ at a constant volume or pressure respectively. We then use .$n$ instead of .$m$ in our heat equations: $$\\Delta Q = nC_V \\Delta T\\ \\ \\ \\text{[Constant Volume]}$$ $$\\Delta Q = nC_P \\Delta T\\ \\ \\ \\text{[Constant Pressure]}$$ which we can then relate to the specific heat with .$M$ as the molecular mass of the gas, .$m/n$ in grams/mol: $$C_V = Mc_V$$ $$C_p = Mc_p$$ In a heating process, when .$\\Delta V = 0$ then the heat added, .$Q_V$ goes entirely into internal energy: .$Q_V = \\Delta E_\\text{int}$ However, when pressure is constant work is done. Thus, heat added, .$Q_P$, goes towards increasing internal energy and work: .$W=P\\Delta V$  Therefore, more heat is needed for a constant pressure system: .$Q_P = \\Delta E_\\text{int} + P\\Delta V$   Since .$\\Delta E_\\text{int}$ is the same for both processes, we can write .$Q_P - Q_V = P \\Delta V$  With an ideal gas, we know .$V = nRT/P$ so .$\\Delta V = nR\\Delta T/P$ which we can combine with the prior equations to get: $$nC_P\\Delta T - nC_V \\Delta T = P\\bigg(\\frac{nR\\Delta T}{P}\\bigg) \\Longrightarrow C_P - C_V = R$$   We can also relate internal energy to molar specific heat for monatomic gases at constant volumes: $$\\Delta E_\\text{int} = Q_V \\Longrightarrow \\frac{3}{2}nRT = nC_V\\Delta T \\Longrightarrow C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$$ We can then plug in our new value for .$C_V$ into the second to last equation .$C_P - C_V = R$ to get .$C_P = \\frac{5}{2}R$ for a monatomic gas.  Equipartition of Energy #    Degrees of Freedom: The number of independent ways a molecule can posses energy  Degrees of freedom depend on the temperature At low temperatures, the only degree of freedom is from translational .$KE$  Starting after .$0K$ Diatomic gas: .$C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$ (3 for each axis) Sum of .$\\frac{1}{2}m \\langle v_x, v_y, v_z \\rangle$   At \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; temperatures, the molecules posses rotation energy  Around .$50K$ Diatomic gas: .$C_V = \\frac{5}{2}R$ Sum of .$\\frac{1}{2}I \\langle 0, \\omega_y, \\omega_z \\rangle$ (since it\u0026rsquo;s rotating about .$\\hat x$ meaning .$E_{\\text{rotational, }x}) = 0$   At higher temperatures, the molecules gain energy associated with their vibrations:  Around .$1000K$ One from KE of the molecules vibrating back and forth: .$\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\text{COM}}^2$ The second from PE of the vibrational motion (think of this as a spring\u0026rsquo;s PE): .$\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$   Solids:  The molar temperature of solids at high temperatures is close to .$3R$. At high temperatures, there are six degrees of freedom: three from vibrational KE in the .$x, y,$ and .$z$ axis and three more from spring PE in the same axis Some of these degrees of freedom aren\u0026rsquo;t active at lower temperatures     Principle of Equipartition of Energy: Energy is shared equally among degrees of freedom and each degrees has energy .$\\frac{1}{2}k_B T$  Thus, for a particle with three degrees of freedom (such as a monatomic gas) .$C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$ Diatomic gases have five degrees so they have .$C_V = \\frac{5}{2}R = 4.97 \\text{ cal/(mol K)}$ and have .$E_\\text{int} = N(\\frac{5}{2}k_B T) = n C_V \\Delta T = \\frac{5}{2}nRT$ where .$n$ is the number of moles and .$N$ is the number of molecules    19.9 Adiabatic Expansion of a Gas #   The .$PV$ curve for adiabatic expansion (.$Q=0$) is slightly less steep than isothermal processes (.$\\Delta T = 0$)  This means that for the same change in volume, the pressure will be greater in adiabatic processes Therefore, the temperature of a gas must drop in adiabatic expansion and rise in adiabatic compression   We can relate .$P$ and .$V$ for a quasistatic expansion / compression with $$PV^\\gamma = \\text{[constant] for } \\gamma = \\frac{C_P}{C_V}$$  19.10 Heat Transfer #  Conduction #   Conduction can be visualized thinking of molecular collisions  The hot end of an object has fast moving molecules These molecules bump into other molecules, transferring them some of their own KE This keeps repeating down the object   Free electrons are the primary source of these collisions Heat conduction only occurs when there is a difference in temperatures Heat conduction rate is proportional to the difference in temperatures: $$\\frac{Q}{t} = kA\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{l}$$ Where .$A$ is the cross section area, .$l$ is the distance between the two ends, and .$k$ is a constant called thermal conductivity that depends on the material  Good insulator have a low .$k$ Building materials sometimes list the thermal resistance, .$R$, which is equal to .$R = \\frac{l}{k}$ where .$l$ is the material\u0026rsquo;s thickness  Larger .$R$ means better insulation     If .$k$ or .$A$ isn\u0026rsquo;t constant, we consider a small thickness: $$ \\frac{dQ}{dt} = -kA \\frac{dT}{dx}$$ .$\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{l} \\text{and} \\frac{dT}{dx}$ is called the temperature gradient We have a negative sign in the equation above because the direction of heat flow is opposite to the temperature gradient  Convection #   Convection involves heat flowing by the bulk movement of molecules from one place to another Whereas conduction involved molecules/electrons moving over small distances, convection involves the movement of a large number of molecules over a long distance Natural Convection occurs in systems where a cold substance (air, water) is warmed and subsequently expands, decreasing density and thus rising  Radiation #    Whereas conduction and convection require a medium, radiation doesn\u0026rsquo;t\n The sun\u0026rsquo;s rays are a form of heat and travel through (nearly empty) space  Radiation of the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays arrive on a clear day at a rate around .$1000 \\text{W/m}^2$   Most of the time radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, but infrared (IR) wavelengths are responsible for heating Earth    The rate at which energy leaves a radiation object, .$Q/t$, is $$ \\frac{Q}{t} \\epsilon \\sigma A T^4$$\n  .$\\epsilon$ is called emissivity.\n Between 0 and 1 Characteristic of the surface of the radiating material Black surfaces close to one, shiny metal surfaces close to zero Depends slightly on the temperature of the material A good absorber is also a good emitter  A black tee shirt gets very hot because it absorbs nearly all the radiation that hits it      .$\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant: .$\\sigma = 5.67 \\cdot 10^{-8} \\text{ W/(m}^2 \\text{K}^4\\text{)}$\n  Objects also absorb heat of surrounding objects. This net heat flow can be found by $$ \\frac{Q}{t} \\epsilon \\sigma A (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$$\n  Where .$T_1$ is the object\u0026rsquo;s temperature and .$T_2$ is the surrounding environment\u0026rsquo;s temperature\n  .$T_1 \u0026gt; T_2$: net flow of heat is from object to the surroundings\n  .$T_1 \u0026lt; T_2$: net flow of heat is from surroundings into object, raising the object temperature\n  "},{"id":7,"href":"/anthro-c12ac/core/","title":"Core","section":"Anthro C12AC","content":"Anthropocene #   The time when human activity began to have an influence on (global) landscape due to our use of fire Large subject used in a range of fields \u0026ndash; no single definition Defining feature: combustion of carbon and greenhouse gases Ice core measurement technique  As ice forms, methane and .$CO_2$ get trapped along with ash/dust/pollen which scientists can measure Ice can be dated so we can compare these variables so we can see change in greenhouse gases over time   Beginning is disputed  Industrial revolution (1780s)  Most popular among scholars   Atomic Testing (1940s)  The isotopic by-products of bomb testing provide a distinctive marker horizon in ice cores, ocean and lake sediments, and soils   Stages idea:  Includes vital events such as forest cutting and grassland conversion: the two largest spatial transformations of Earth‚Äôs surface in human history   1.8 million years ago: When fire was discovered 6000-4000s years ago: With neolithic agriculture 1780s: Industrial revolution     Identifying fire requirements:  Evidence of temporal or spatial changes in fire activity and vegetation Demonstration that these changes are not predicted by climate parameters alone Temporal/spatial coincidence between fire regime changes and changes in the human record    Pyrogeography #   History of the variation of fire activity over space and time at the landscape scale in different regions of the world Pyrogeography started in Silurian period when plant life began Fire requirements: .$13 \\%\\ O_2$ in a normal environment and .$30%$ in damp vegetation. Fires are a selection force in the evolution of plants  Four phases for Pyrogeography #  1. Natural Biospheric Fire \u0026ndash; Natural Fire Regime #   (Potential) start date for pyrogeography During Silurian and Devonian Periods (440-400 HYA) Natural fire regime started during this period because it was the first time that the fire triangle came together Fire triangle:  Ignition Source: (Since beginning) Natural ignition from lightening, volcanoes, (rarely) falling rock sparks  These natural sources tend to only begin fires in the dry season   Oxygen Source: (Cambrian period) Atmospheric Oxygen (from photosynthetic plants) leads to appearance of photosynthetic organisms Fuel Source: (Silurian and Devonian Periods) Enough terrestrial plants in ecosystems to acts as fuel   During this time, natural fire regimes evolved  As coal became more common (Carboniferous period), fires did too    2. Wildland Anthropogenic Fire \u0026ndash; Hunter/Gatherer Fire Regime #    When people began acting as the ignition source\n  Primarily used fire for domestic cases\n Heating, cooking, warmth, etc.    When people move to a new land\n Major changes in fauna, vegetation, and fires (charcoal) People seem to bring fire with them as they migrate    Start dates\n 40 ka for Australia  90% of fauna went extinct Lots of evidence of fire   45 ka for Highland New Guinea 50 ka for lowland Borneo 20 ka for the Americas  Extinctions of many animals and vegetation  Debate: are these because of natural process like climate change (ice age -\u0026gt; post ice age?) or do people play a large role   Native Perspective ‚Äì Indigenous people have been here since time began      When did humans actually discover fire? #   Defining the bridge between phase one and two is difficult Definition problems  Do we ask when did (modern humans / hominin ancestors) develop the ability to control and utilize fire? We also need to distinguish between (1) controlling / utilizing fire and (2) being able to start a fire on a whim   Archeological problems  Fire exists naturally, so we can\u0026rsquo;t assume all fire evidence is from human action Other natural processes can look like fire (e.g. staining by minerals in soil, oxidation causing reddish patches) Combustion of natural objects (e.g. bushes) can leave charcoal which looks like a human hearth  Additionally, evidence of a hearth doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that humans started/controlled fire     Archaeological Record Analysis  In the field:  Observation and collection of materials Study the geology of the site   In the lab:  Microscopic analysis to see if there was burning If so, could the location of the sample been transported after combustion? Further, how does the history of the burned object associate with cultural items      How long has fire been controlled? #   Europe: Strong evidence of 400,000 - 300,000 years ago Western Asia: One established case from 780,000 years ago. Other sites are similar to Europe Africa: Claims have been made for a cave site that shows fire around 1.5-1.6 million years ago Note that opportunistic use of fire could have happened much earlier  Eg. lighting a torch from a natural-starting forest fire    3. Agriculture Anthropogenic Fire \u0026ndash; Agricultural Fire Regime #   Required fire to alter the natural vegetation from perennial-dominated to annual-dominated landscapes. People preferred to live in fire-prone places because the burning provides advantages for hunting, foraging, cultivating, and livestock herding  4. Industrial and Domestic Anthropogenic Fire \u0026ndash; Industrial Fire Regime #   Low-severity surface fire regimes are being replaced with low-frequency, high-intensity crown fires that are outside the historical range of variability for these ecosystems Western US: forests have also experienced an increase in hazardous fuels due to highly effective fire suppression policy that excluded fires for much of the 20th century Eastern US: Fire suppression has shifted oak and pine woodlands to mesophytic hardwoods consequently reducing flammability and fire activity Globally: urban areas have steadily expanded into wildland areas  Producing more ignition sources (arson and accidental) Exposing more people to wildfire    Key Factors in Fire Regimes (Discussion 8-30) #   Frequency  The interval of fire occurrences E.x. every four years   Area  Size, distribution, location Ground fires (primarily dead plants) vs crown (burning upper canopy of living trees)  Crown fires areas are more difficult to manage because controlled burns still damage natural resources     Severity  How destructive a fire is Change in dominant species / change in ecosystem Quantifiable by how much soil on the ground is visible   Seasonality  How the season affects fires May or may not be annual May arise due to weather conditions Ex. Annual to decadal cycles of drying conditions   Interactions  General activity on the landscape leading to different fire outcomes Droughts leading to stress on fuels Beatles eating bark, making trees more vulnerable Fire suppression leading to less severe fires Climate change making fires more severe    Biodiversity and Fire as a Selective Variable in Evolution #   .$C_4$ grass  Spread during seasonal climate in the tertiary period (when fires became more common) Fires lead to woodlands and created environments favorable to .$C_4$ grasslands Since .$C_4$ is high flammability, it would have produced a feedback process that further increased fire activity,  Thus maintaining the grassland-dominated landscape This process is similar to the one currently maintaining many of our savannas     Plant attributes  Heat shock  Certain species have seeds that will open with heat Not exclusive to fire; correlated with soil heat too   Smoke  Highly selective and specific to fire Smoke is a mixture of specific chemicals unique to itself   Note that plants become resistant to certain fire regimes, not necessarily all  Changes in fire regime can kill off fire resistant plants     Even small differences in the deployment of fire outside of natural lightning strikes can alter patterns of forest succession, fuel availability, and seasonality of ignitions  Fires Relating to Evolution #   Beneficial Attributes  Cooking hypothesis  Key claim: Fire + cooking started with the Homo erectus. As such, humans have evolved around a cooked diet that they can\u0026rsquo;t live without Led to fitness advantage More energy + nutrient from food, enabling body and brain size increase Detoxing effect Increase digestibility of all food Cooking takes time, leading to social development  Distribution of tasks among group: (collection, preparation, even stealing)   Cooking accounts for reduction in jaw, tooth size (due to softer food), stomach, and digestive system size There is no evidence of modern human societies existing without cooked food Counterpoints:  It\u0026rsquo;s still unclear that Homo erectus controlled fire There are some sites that show no example of cooking: e.g. Neanderthal sites in cold climates Energetic effects aren\u0026rsquo;t well quantified Digestive evolution may not have been linear; other adaptations related to fire occurred after Homo erectus     Protection benefits at night (especially versus the alternative: sleeping in trees) Allowed much better vision in caves  Enables cave art   Evidence that some hominids could use fire to morph certain woods into tools (e.g. digging sticks, hafted spears) Allowed humans to colonize colder environments Increase prey abundances, maintain mosaic landscapes, and increase pyrodiversity and succession stage heterogeneity   Social bonding  Led to camp fires Allows people to stay up later Fire could be used as a story telling enhancer, means to pass on history, culture, etc. Provides a sense of intimacy and openness Opportunity for music    Fire-stick farming  clearing ground for human habitats facilitating travel killing vermin, hunting regenerating plant food sources for both humans and livestock warfare among tribes   Woody, closed-canopy shrublands were opened up or entirely displaced  Led to spread of fast-growing annual species that provided greater seed resources, travel, and hunting and planting opportunities Ex. CA land was only used for agriculture after burnings, which led to many other alien plants spreading too Reductions in arboreal cover and woody understory have the most potential to enhance erosion Reshaping of landscapes has posed problems for ecologists trying to understand contemporary landscape patterns    Overview of Fires in California #   Conflagrating California\n ~54% of CA ecosystems depend on fire The remaining ecosystems that aren\u0026rsquo;t too extreme for fires (so not deserts, stony summits, wetlands, etc.) are fire adapted  \u0026ldquo;Fire season is 13 months\u0026rdquo;\n  CA has a diverse ecosystem; each site is similar to another one elsewhere though What sets CA apart is the scale and intensity of it\u0026rsquo;s fires    CA\u0026rsquo;s fires are unique in that they lead national discourse Texas views the US as France views the EUnion \u0026ndash; a canvas to project it\u0026rsquo;s ideals Alaska view the US as a source of subsidies. It\u0026rsquo;s isolated and treated almost as a commonwealth. California shares sizes, political isolation, and sense of selfhood with the aforementioned.  Unlike AL, it has a strong and wide economy Unlike TX, it has been independent but not secessionist and, while CA and TX both have strong cultures, CA doesn\u0026rsquo;t project its   Importance - 1/9 Americans live in CA - 8th largest economy - Social uses 1/2 the national fire budget - Source (and testing ground) of new firefighting technology  \u0026ldquo;CA is like the rest of the US, just more so\u0026rdquo;\n     Two CA  North and south Sierra and Seacoast Rich and poor Scrubland, megalopolis, \u0026amp; wilderness Lowest and highest elevation in nation (Mount Whitney @ 14,500 ft and Death Valley @ -280 ft)   Sierra Nevada is analogous to NoCal  Big tilt Highest in SE and slants lower to N + W Mostly timber More frequent fires   Transverse Range is analogous to SoCal  Big Kink Highest in E, bends sharp W then trails to pacific and N Mostly bush More intense fires 56% of ppl live on 8% of land      CA is a national innovator  Created geological survey in 1860 Created Board of Forestry in 1885 Set standard for fire control   Light-burning controversy  Pro-burn:  Frontier practices  the Indian way of forest management\n  Advocated for regular burning montane woods and lowlands NoCal   Pro-protection  Use govt to prevent\\fight fires SoCal   National issue debated in CA 1923: Light-burning anathematized      Leopold report, Wilderness Act, and Tall Timbers fire ecology conferences  Began in 1962 Aimed to transform fire control into fire management Good for conservation + private land owners who wanted traditional working landscapes Loggers and ranchers started moving out at this time Didn\u0026rsquo;t target urban areas   Urban Areas  Used fire suppression  CA to spawn as AK to wilderness\n  Fires in SoCal rained embers onto cities SoCal retaliated w larger firefighting force   New Practices  Operation Firestop: Transform tech into operational programs 1956: Aerial tankers used to drop retardant on firelines 1961: Specialty fire crews expanded nationally 1963: Forest Service opened Western Fire Lab to coordinate fire suppression w air attacks 1970: Organized SoCal fire agencies towards common practices   Area Specialty  Florida: Prescribed fire N Rockies: Management over back countries (So)Cal: Fire suppression  Land management in Cali was synonymous to fire management, thus fire suppression        As CA grew, the motivation for fire suppression was primarily economical This lead to divisive debates of suppression vs let-burn  When there were flames, it was fight or flight   Many fire ideas spread from CA  Often transformed and simplified      Fires are especially susceptible due to Scioecological Systems (SES)  History of fires suppression Climate change More extreme fire weather Expanding development Droughts   Difficult to predict future fire regimes well Changes in human behavior can amplify, but tend to cancel out climatic effects on fire regimes  For example, humans alter through changing land use, ignitions, fuel conditions, or fire suppression Fire activity is influenced by climate variability  More (less) fire occurred in dry (wet) and warm (cool) years, and high-fire years were preceded by moist and sometimes cool conditions 1‚Äì4 y earlier.   (Sierra Nevada) fire-regime shifts correlate to SES changes, not shifts in climate.   Are best bet is to look at history and see how fire regimes changed from past changes in socioeconomic variables  Climate increased fire activity on a large-scale after Native American depopulation reduced the buffering effect of due to their burnings  Sierra Nevada tribes were hunter-gatherers who used sophisticated burning practices to manage resources The fire index nearly doubled after depopulation   Later Euro-American settlement and fire suppression buffered fire activity from temperature increases  Logging, fire suppression, livestock increase (grazing effects)      The overall sensitivity of fire regimes to low-frequency temperature variation is related to temperature-driven vegetation changes that alter fuel structure and fuel type #    Peopling of North America #    Traditional Perspective ‚Äì Clovis First Model\n 13,000 ka, there was an ice-free corridor that opened up and let people come to north America  People from Asia follow herds of megafauna across Bering Strait ( Beringia)   We have found kill sites across America  Butchered mammoth, horses, bison, ground sloths, etc.      New Thoughts about Peopling of Americas: Multiple Migrations of People 20,000-40,000 years ago\n  Coastal Migration Model:\n Use Boats to Come to Americas from Asia Some travels may not have been successful which is why there is less evidence for this theory Based on:  Evidence sophisticated cultures  Art, pottery, (primitive) technology, etc.   Evidence of maritime seafaring at early date (Australia, New Guinea, Japan) People follow the Kelp Highway Maritime  Kelp forests very productive (food source) Kelp Highway went along Pacific Rim        Peopling of California #    Earliest well dated sites in CA (13,000-10,000 BP) [Based on radio carbon dates]\n Sites located in SoCal: Channel Islands, South Coast These Islands have always been separated by water so we know people had boats relatively early    Find Evidence of Shell Middens\n Contain shell, fish, other maritime foods Have evidence of tools for kelp + technology Big Game Kill Sites rare in California Dietary Differences (Midwest/Plains vs California)  Perhaps because of dietary differences Suggests different groups of people, so potentially different groups of migrants      Major Changes observed on Channel Islands\n Changes in Fauna (Pygmy Mammoths) Changes in Flora Evidence of Fires!

Coring Lakes #    Annual layers are laid down in some lakes  Realistically you can date to around fifty years of accuracy This samples have deeper temporal depth vs other methods We can also radiocarbon date these samples to determine the time period   What to sample  Charcoal present is indicates fire  Larger particle tend to travel small distances Smaller particles can travel much longer distances   Pollen analysis can give you knowledge on what (wind pollinated) plants were common at the time in that area Phytoliths  Tiny particles formed in many plants They don\u0026rsquo;t break down \u0026ndash; can stay in soil for hundreds to thousands of years! Can be used to identify plant species      2. Coring Trees #    You basically jab a metal straw into a tree and get a sample of the tree  Doesn\u0026rsquo;t harm tree, tree naturally patches the hole itself   These sample contain rings Give us age and growth rate of the tree  Growth increase in rings can allude to neighboring trees being killed Dead neighboring trees means less canopy blocking sunshine and less trees competing for nutrients   Multiple samples can give us an overview of a landscape  Do we see a multi-age forest? Do we see synchrony in growth rate?   Crossdating: To identify events, we compare the sample\u0026rsquo;s tree rings to those of other \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; trees in different areas at the same time    Note that the example above is a rare occurrence  3. Fire Scars #    Fire scars occur when fire kills part of the cambium below bark, leaving a wound Multiple dated wounds allude to multiple fire occurrences You can also get the seasonality too  Spring trees have warmer water so the scars are lighter in color Fall/winter trees have slower cell movement, so the scars are darker (this is called \u0026ldquo;latewood\u0026rdquo;) Therefore, how deep the scar is in the wood corresponds to the season the fire occurred   Use crossdating for high accuracy and precision Wedges:  You can take wedges from the tree to get access to the ring view Both living and dead wood samples can be dated Pines, redwood, cedar, giant sequoia are all rot resistant thus good species to sample You ideally want to cut a thin wedge that has a large surface area and includes center of tree   Trees heal covering up scars or scars are in an exposed cavity that can be seen Problem when fire interval \u0026lt; 10 years  Most of the time fires aren\u0026rsquo;t severe enough to scare deeply enough Only 5% of trees sampled scarred in Sierra Nevada    Fire History Study Sierra Nevada #   Two large sampling areas, one north and south Sierra Nevada Systematic fire history sample in mixed conifer forests Important confluence of at least 3 Tribes: Sierra Miwok, Yokut, and Western Mono.
