<li>(Potential) start date for pyrogeography</li>
<li>During 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian">Silurian</a> and Devonian Periods (440-400 HYA)</li>
<li>Natural fire regime started during this period because it was the first time that the fire triangle came together</li>
<li>Fire triangle:
<ul>
<li><em>Ignition Source</em>: (Since beginning) Natural ignition from lightening, volcanoes, (rarely) falling rock sparks
<ul>
<li>These natural sources tend to only begin fires in the dry season</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Oxygen Source</em>: (Cambrian period) Atmospheric Oxygen (from photosynthetic plants) leads to appearance of photosynthetic organisms</li>
<li><em>Fuel Source</em>: (Silurian and Devonian Periods) Enough terrestrial plants in ecosystems to acts as fuel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During this time, natural fire regimes evolved

<ul>
<li>Defining the bridge between phase one and two is difficult</li>
<li>Definition problems
<ul>
<li>Do we ask when did (modern humans / hominin ancestors) develop the ability to control and utilize fire?</li>
<li>We also need to distinguish between (1) controlling / utilizing fire and (2) being able to start a fire on a whim</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Archeological problems
<ul>
<li>Fire exists naturally, so we can&rsquo;t assume all fire evidence is from human action</li>
<li>Other natural processes can look like fire (e.g. staining by minerals in soil, oxidation causing reddish patches)</li>
<li>Combustion of natural objects (e.g. bushes) can leave charcoal which looks like a human hearth
<ul>
<li>Additionally, evidence of a hearth doesn&rsquo;t mean that humans started/controlled fire</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Archaeological Record Analysis
<ul>
<li>In the field:
<ul>
<li>Observation and collection of materials</li>
<li>Study the geology of the site</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the lab:
<ul>
<li>Microscopic analysis to see if there was burning</li>
<li>If so, could the location of the sample been transported after combustion?</li>
<li>Further, how does the history of the burned object associate with cultural items</li>

<li><strong>Western Asia</strong>: One established case from 780,000 years ago. Other sites are similar to Europe</li>
<li><strong>Africa</strong>: Claims have been made for a cave site that shows fire around 1.5-1.6 million years ago</li>

<li>Low-severity surface fire regimes are being replaced with low-frequency, high-intensity crown fires that are outside the historical range of variability for these ecosystems</li>
<li><em>Western US</em>: forests have also experienced an increase in hazardous fuels due to highly effective fire suppression policy that excluded fires for much of the 20th century</li>
<li><em>Eastern US</em>: Fire suppression has shifted oak and pine woodlands to mesophytic hardwoods consequently reducing flammability and fire activity</li>
<li><em>Globally</em>: urban areas have steadily expanded into wildland areas
<ul>
<li>Producing more ignition sources (arson and accidental)</li>
<li>Exposing more people to wildfire</li>

<li>Beneficial Attributes
<ul>
<li>Cooking hypothesis
<ul>
<li>Key claim: Fire + cooking started with the Homo erectus. As such, humans have evolved around a cooked diet that they can&rsquo;t live without</li>
<li>Led to fitness advantage</li>
<li>More energy + nutrient from food, enabling body and brain size increase</li>
<li>Detoxing effect</li>
<li>Increase digestibility of all food</li>
<li>Cooking takes time, leading to social development
<ul>
<li>Distribution of tasks among group: (collection, preparation, even stealing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cooking accounts for reduction in jaw, tooth size (due to softer food), stomach, and digestive system size</li>
<li>There is no evidence of modern human societies existing without cooked food</li>
<li>Counterpoints:
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s still unclear that Homo erectus controlled fire</li>
<li>There are some sites that show no example of cooking: e.g. Neanderthal sites in cold climates</li>
<li>Energetic effects aren&rsquo;t well quantified</li>
<li>Digestive evolution may not have been linear; other adaptations related to fire occurred after Homo erectus</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Protection benefits at night (especially versus the alternative: sleeping in trees)</li>
<li>Allowed much better vision in caves
<ul>
<li>Enables cave art</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence that some hominids could use fire to morph certain woods into tools (e.g. digging sticks, hafted spears)</li>
<li>Allowed humans to colonize colder environments</li>
<li>Increase prey abundances, maintain mosaic landscapes, and increase pyrodiversity and succession stage heterogeneity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social bonding
<ul>
<li>Led to camp fires</li>
<li>Allows people to stay up later</li>
<li>Fire could be used as a story telling enhancer, means to pass on history, culture, etc.</li>

<li>regenerating plant food sources for both humans and livestock</li>
<li>warfare among tribes</li>

</li>
<li>Woody, closed-canopy shrublands were opened up or entirely displaced
<ul>
<li>Led to spread of fast-growing annual species that provided greater seed resources, travel, and hunting and planting opportunities</li>
<li>Ex. CA land was only used for agriculture after burnings, which led to many other alien plants spreading too</li>
<li>Reductions in arboreal cover and woody understory have the most potential to enhance erosion</li>

<li>Expanding development</li>
<li>Droughts</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Difficult to predict future fire regimes well</li>
<li>Changes in human behavior can amplify, but tend to <em>cancel out climatic effects</em> on fire regimes
<ul>
<li>For example, humans alter through changing land use, ignitions, fuel conditions, or fire suppression</li>
<li>Fire <strong>activity</strong> is influenced by climate variability
<ul>
<li>More (less) fire occurred in dry (wet) and warm (cool) years, and high-fire years were preceded by moist and sometimes cool conditions 1â€“4 y earlier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Sierra Nevada) <strong>fire-regime shifts</strong> correlate to <strong>SES changes</strong>, <em>not shifts in climate</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are best bet is to look at history and see how fire regimes changed from past changes in socioeconomic variables
<ul>
<li>Climate increased fire activity on a large-scale <strong>after Native American depopulation</strong> reduced the buffering effect of due to their burnings
<ul>
<li>Sierra Nevada tribes were hunter-gatherers who used sophisticated burning practices to manage resources</li>
<li>The fire index nearly doubled after depopulation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Later Euro-American settlement and fire suppression buffered fire activity from temperature increases
<ul>
<li>Logging, fire suppression, livestock increase (grazing effects)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The overall sensitivity of fire regimes to low-frequency temperature variation is related to temperature-driven vegetation changes that alter fuel structure and fuel type</li>

<li>Due to&hellip;
<ul>
<li>Climate Change
<ul>
<li>Climate change at end of Ice Age
<ul>
<li>Mega herbivores died after ice age, increasing fuel sources (vegetation) which we can see with charcoal signatures</li>

<li>Newest theory</li>
<li>Estimated that 5km comet hit earth somewhere</li>

<li>Realistically you can date to around fifty years of accuracy</li>
<li>This samples have deeper temporal depth vs other methods</li>
<li>We can also radiocarbon date these samples to determine the time period</li>

</li>
<li>What to sample
<ul>
<li>Charcoal present is indicates fire
<ul>
<li>Larger particle tend to travel small distances</li>
<li>Smaller particles can travel much longer distances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pollen analysis can give you knowledge on what (wind pollinated) plants were common at the time in that area</li>
<li>Phytoliths

<li>Doesn&rsquo;t harm tree, tree naturally patches the hole itself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These sample contain rings</li>
<li>Give us age and growth rate of the tree
<ul>
<li>Growth increase in rings can allude to neighboring trees being killed</li>
<li>Dead neighboring trees means less canopy blocking sunshine and less trees competing for nutrients</li>

<li>Multiple samples can give us an overview of a landscape
<ul>
<li>Do we see a multi-age forest?</li>

<ul>
<li>Fire scars occur when fire kills part of the cambium below bark, leaving a wound</li>
<li>Multiple dated wounds allude to multiple fire occurrences</li>
<li>You can also get the seasonality too
<ul>
<li>Spring trees have warmer water so the scars are lighter in color</li>
<li>Fall/winter trees have slower cell movement, so the scars are darker (this is called &ldquo;latewood&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Therefore, how deep the scar is in the wood corresponds to the season the fire occurred</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use crossdating for high accuracy and precision</li>
<li>Wedges:
<ul>
<li>You can take wedges from the tree to get access to the ring view</li>
<li>Both living and dead wood samples can be dated</li>
<li>Pines, redwood, cedar, giant sequoia are all rot resistant thus good species to sample</li>
<li>You ideally want to cut a thin wedge that has a large surface area and includes center of tree</li>

<li>Mostly small Tribal territories</li>
<li>Crowded Landscapes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Complex Societies
<ul>
<li>Village Communities have Elaborate Ritual and Political Organizations
<ul>
<li>Different people would specialize in different areas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Food Storage (Granaries)</li>
<li>Sophisticated Material Culture: Baskets, Shell Beads, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-Agrarian People
<ul>
<li>No formal agriculture practices outside SE CA</li>
<li>Sustainer primarily by hunting/gathering (use of wild plants and gatherers)</li>
<li>Adjacent Areas â€“ neighboring people would grow corn, beans, squash but Indians chose not to practice agriculture</li>
<li>Perception about Non-Agrarian people Changed over time
<ul>
<li>(Falsely) Seen initially as passive foragers that minimal impact to environment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indigenous Stewards of Land and Sea
<ul>
<li>Better way of describing CA Indians (compared to hunter gatherers)</li>
<li>Indians worked/work as <strong>Active Agents to Augment Environmental Productivity and Diversity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Seascape Stewardship</strong>:  Various ways Native people enhanced the productivity and sustainability of shellfish populations and fisheries</li>
<li><strong>Landscape Stewardship</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Anthropological Rethinking back to 1940s, picks up steam in 1970s, 1980s that culminates with Anderson 2005 publication</li>
<li>Various Methods Employed in Landscape Management Practices:
<ul>
<li>Transplanting Water Diversion</li>
<li>Pruning/Coppicing</li>
<li>Weeding/Tillage Sowing/Broadcasting Seeds</li>
<li>All for the purpose of enhancing productivity of natural plants/animals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Most Important</strong>: Anthropogenic or Cultural Burning was the key method of stewardship
<ul>
<li>Long History in California (Channel Islands)?</li>
<li>Mediterranean Climate is Fire Enabler
<ul>
<li>Wet cool winters lead to high plant production</li>
<li>Dry and drought-ful summers provide a dry, extensive fuel base</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Native Californians realized that fire was a natural occurrence and learned to live with fire</li>
<li>Reasoning for Cultural Burnings (Landscape scale)
<ol>
<li>Fires Control Insects/Pests</li>
<li>Remove Detritus, clean-up landscape</li>
<li>Open Pathways</li>
<li>Use Fire to Hunt Game (driving animals into traps/valleys) and Insects</li>
<li>Produce Straight Stems for cordage, baskets</li>
<li>Augment Growth/Diversity of Plants and Animals in Territory</li>
<li>Increases productivity of nutrient rich plants that animals eat
<ul>
<li>Deer heard sizes are correlated with burnings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>How Areas Were Burned
<ul>
<li>Instigate fire regimes with frequent, small, low-intensity surface burns
<ul>
<li>Seasonality of burning very important to minimize risk of catastrophic fires</li>
<li>Additionally, risk reduced by reduce fuel loads + creating fuel breaks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Burn to increase productivity and stimulate growth of broad spectrum of economic resources
<ul>
<li>Notably shrubs with berries, oak woodlands, coniferous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intentionally create Patchy Mosaics
<ul>
<li>Different environments benefit from different style burnings resulting in checkerboard-esque patterns</li>
<li>Increase quantity, diversity and sustainability of key plants and animals</li>
<li>Used for foods, medicines, and raw materials</li>
<li>Minimize risk of catastrophic fires due to reduced fuel loads and fire breaks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Burn areas contained by natural rivers/hills/ridges/basalt flows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implications of Cultural Burning
<ul>
<li>Not Pristine Wilderness, but Managed Anthropogenic Landscape &ndash; you have to take into account Indians when looking at CA&rsquo;s landscape</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t do restoration without bringing in people
<ul>
<li>Now, because of a lack of recent cultural burnings, some habitats are struggling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Controversy regarding cultural burnings
<ul>
<li>Some argue that cultural fires were small in size, near villages, and had little impact on the larger ecosystem</li>
<li>Rather, natural fires best explain these fires</li>
<li>Short Temporal Depth for cultural burnings
<ul>
<li>Observations limited primarily to last 250 years</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limitations arise when primarily referring to Tribal Oral Traditions, Ethnohistoric Observations, Ethnographic Studies
<ul>
<li>Accounts tend to be spotty, geographically biased and not very detailed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ethnographic Studies (observations made by trained anthropologists)
<ul>
<li>Fire Exclusion â€“ by Spanish in 1793</li>
<li>Fire Suppression â€“ picks up in 1890s and early 1900s</li>
<li>Implication:  Ethnography done after 1901</li>
<li>Post-dates time that Native people were able to legally implement Cultural Burning
<ul>
<li>Native people arrested, jailed for cultural burning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
