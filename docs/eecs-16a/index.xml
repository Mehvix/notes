The Gaussian elimination algorithm implied that we needed to take at least 9 measurements to properly identify the 9 bottles in a box so that we had at least one equation per variable.</description></item><item><title>3: Transformations &amp; Inverse</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/eecs-16a/3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/eecs-16a/3/</guid><description>02-08: Matrix Transformations # Slides Note 4 Linear Transformations # Linear Transformation: In the previous practice set, we discussed the idea of a matrix .$A^{M \times N}$ as a linear transformation. Effectively, in the equation .$A \vec x = \vec b$, the matrix itself can be considered a transformation .$f : \mathbb{R}^{N} \to \mathbb{R}^{M}$ which takes a vector .$\vec x^{N \times 1}$ of inputs and returns a vector .</description></item><item><title>4: Vector Spaces &amp; Eigenstuff</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/eecs-16a/4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/eecs-16a/4/</guid><description>02-15: Vector Spaces: Null Spaces and Columnspaces # Slides Notes 7 8 Important Jargon # Rank a matrix .$A$ is the number of linearly independent columns Nullspace of a matrix is the set of solutions to .$A \vec x = 0$ A vector space is a set of vectors connected by two operators: .$+, \times$ &amp;mdash; page 48 A vector subspace is a subset of vectors that have “nice properties” &amp;mdash; page 50 A basis for a vector space is a minimum set of vectors needed to represent all vectors in the space Dimension of a vector space is the number of basis vectors Column space is the span (range) of the columns of a matrix Row space is the span of the rows of a matrix Vector Spaces # A vector space .</description></item><item><title>5: Basis &amp; Circuit Analysis</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/eecs-16a/5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/eecs-16a/5/</guid><description>02-22 Basis # Note 10 Slides Change of Basis # Previously we’ve seen that a basis for a vector space is a minimal spanning set of vectors. We can also define the standard basis vectors, e,x. the standard basis for .$ \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the set .$\mathbb{E}$: $$\mathbb{E} = \big(\hat i, \hat j, \hat k \big)$$ $$\dots \equiv ( \vec e_1, \vec e_2, \vec e_3)$$ $$\dots \equiv \left( \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\\ 0\\ \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 1\\ 0\\ \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 0\\ 1\\ \end{bmatrix}\right) $$ We can represent any set of vectors that form as basis as a linear combination of the standard .</description></item><item><title>6: Voltage Dividers &amp; Measurement</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/eecs-16a/6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/eecs-16a/6/</guid><description>\(\) 03-01: Voltage Dividers # Voltage Divider # The voltage divider circuit consists of a voltage source (.$V_S$) and two resistors (.$R_1$ and .$R_2$) Example: We label the node connected to the voltage supply as .$u_1 (= V_S)$, since the voltage supply goes between this node and ground.
