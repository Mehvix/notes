Brief History # We have records of keeping track of astronomical events, e.x. Movement of the moon and sun across the sky Changes of the length of day Equinoxes, Solstices became ritual dates long ago (typically involved with religion) Phases of the moon (new/full moons) Stonehenge Rock structure in England 4,500 years old Speculated that this may have been an ancient astronomical observatory Cave paintings 15,000 &amp;ndash; 40,000 years old &amp;ndash; Paleolithic Discovered in December 1994 Chauvet, Lascoux, and others across SW Europe People went through an effort to go deep into caves with lamps to create these drawings &amp;ndash; thinking in sophisticated ways Ancient Music Have evidence of an ancient flute made from a bear bone 50,000 years ago Human evolution # Oldest fossils of a direct human ancestor are 5-6 MYA Volcanos spew radioactive elements which become buried Estimated that humans and chimps have evolved independently since 7 MYA Hominin fossils fall into 3 primary groups, or genera: Ardipithecus Climbs in woodlands Can walk on two legs Australopithecus Committed biped Small brain Big teeth and faces Homo Our genus &amp;ndash; homo sapiens &amp;ndash; are the only species remaining today Technological primate; depends on culture Found burial of dead (pets too) along with primitive instruments Species Age Brain Size cm$^3$ Ardipithecus ramidus ~ 4.</description></item><item><title>2: DNA, Synapses, and Neuroanatomy</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/mcb-c61/2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/mcb-c61/2/</guid><description>\(\) 4: Genes and the History of Molecular Biology # Overview of History # Mid-1850s: Charles Darwin proposes that all life is deeply related and that there must be some underlying source of variation that is associated with how information is stored and passed on from one generation to the next. Gregor Mendel investigates inheritance in pea plants, which leads to the idea that information needed to build an organism is packaged into a gene &amp;ndash; some abstract kind of units associated with specific traits, segregated and sorted in reproduction 1920s: Based on groundwork laid by Max Planck in 1900 and Albert Einstein in 1905, a large group of physicists begin to develop Quantum Mechanics.</description></item><item><title>3: Pharmacology; Neurodevelopment</title><link>http://notes.mehvix.com/mcb-c61/3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://notes.mehvix.com/mcb-c61/3/</guid><description>\(\) 8: Poison, Medicine, and Pharmacology # Pharmakon: medicine and poison at the same time Everything is a poison. The difference between a poison and a remedy depends on the dose. &amp;ndash; Paracelsus
Botulinum Toxin Strongest toxin known Disrupts acetylcholine transmitters of neuromuscular junctions Human LD$_{50}$ = lethal dose for 50%: 2 ng / kg E.x. lethal dose for 50kg is 100ng Therapeutic (Botox) dosage: ~5ng Therapeutic Index (TI): lethal dose / therapeutic dose E.</description></item></channel></rss>
