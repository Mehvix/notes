<a class=anchor href=#week-2-january-25--27-the-racialization-of-asian-americans-contemporary-images-and-historical-transformations>#</a></h1><p>Reading: Okihiro, <em>Common Ground</em>, Preface & Ch. 2: “White and Black.”</p><p><strong>Class Question:</strong> Okihiro writes in his preface that his book <em>Common Ground</em> is about the &ldquo;creation of the American character and subject.&rdquo;</p><p>What does he mean by that?</p><ul><li>the social construction of the nation</li></ul><p><strong>Binaries as convenient cognitive and socio-political constructs</strong></p><ul><li>Binaries offer coherence, especially during times of social upheaval. They preserve rule amidst apparaent chaos, and stability amidst rapid change, such as during the late eighteenth, nineteenth, and twntieth centuries (i.e industrial revolution, enlightenment, romanticism). Those periods of American history occasioned social reconstitutions of geographies, race, gender, sexuality and nationality that helped to define and regulate identities, the state, and the social formation.</li></ul><p><strong>Break out question:</strong> What are some modern-day binaries and what socio-political institutions or relationships and hierarchies do they support?</p><ul><li>gender norms, environmental conservation, wealth inequality</li></ul><p><strong>What are some binary ideas or myths based on the social construction of an East vs. West divide?</strong></p><ul><li>Rudyard Kipling <em>The Ballad of East and West</em>, 1889<blockquote><p>Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,
Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God&rsquo;s great Judgment Seat;
But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,
When two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends of the earth!</p></blockquote><ul><li>These poems pervade our perceptions and are descriptors for historical moments in time. They are important signifiers of binaries</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Model Minority vs. Perpetual Foreigner</strong></p><ul><li>Are these two poles of the social construction of Asian Americans binary?</li><li>How do they serve to construct the &ldquo;Asian American subject?&rdquo;</li></ul><p><strong>Korematsu v. United States</strong></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;In response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, the U.S. government decided to require Japanese-Americans to move into relocation camps as a matter of national security. President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, two months after Pearl Harbor. A Japanese-American man living in San Leandro, Fred Korematsu, chose to stay at his residence rather than obey the order to relocate. Korematsu was arrested and convicted of violating the order. He responded by arguing that Executive Order 9066 violated the Fifth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit affirmed Korematsu&rsquo;s conviction.&rdquo; - Oyez</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Court ruled against Korematsu. The Court believed that the decision was valid because it was a necessity amid the danger of espionage and sabotage.</li></ul><p><strong>Common ground vs. Margins as the Mainstream</strong></p><ul><li>Okihiro writes that his book seeks to reject binaries and to advocate for a &ldquo;open, borderless&rdquo; common ground" versus his prior argument that the mainstream norms, rights, values of America were created by the margins.<ul><li>meaning that the <em>margins create the mainstream.</em></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Race Conscious Judicial Review and Black/White Paradigm</strong></p><ul><li>Race relations in the United States have rapidly evolved in recent decades however, race scholars often point to a persistent paradigm that views racial difference primarily through the construction of black and white relations.</li></ul><p><strong>Binarism and Black White as a paradigm</strong></p><ul><li>Okirhiro says that the American race <em>paradigm</em> views race relations in terms of black and white.</li></ul><p><strong>Separate but Equal: <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> (1896)</strong></p><ul><li>Louisiana&rsquo;s <em>Separate Car Act</em> challenged under the 14th Amendment</li></ul><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Louisiana enacted the Separate Car Act, which required separate railway cars for blacks and whites. In 1892, Homer Plessy – who was seven-eighths Caucasian – agreed to participate in a test to challenge the Act. He was solicited by the Comite des Citoyens (Committee of Citizens), a group of New Orleans residents who sought to repeal the Act. They asked Plessy, who was technically black under Louisiana law, to sit in a &ldquo;whites only&rdquo; car of a Louisiana train&mldr;When Plessy was told to vacate the whites-only car, he refused and was arrested&mldr;Plessy was convicted.&rdquo; - Oyez</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The Court declared the state law constitutional. In essence, segregation did not constitute unlawful discrimination.</li></ul><p><strong>Constructive blacks</strong></p><ul><li>Law scholar Frank Wu argues that our legal system construes &ldquo;racial groups as white, blacks, &ldquo;honorary whites or constructive blacks.&rdquo;<ul><li>What does &ldquo;constructive&rdquo; mean?<ul><li>The legal system has treated Asians, mostly as blacks. Applied the same rules to Asians as they would to Blacks.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>He says historically, the U.S. legal system has treated Asians mostly as &ldquo;constructive blacks.&rdquo;<ul><li><em>People v. Hall</em>, 1854 (CA state court attributed black status to Asians in enforcing a statue (passed by a legislative body) prohibiting the testimony of blacks, reasoning that &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; was a generic term for all nonwhites).</li><li><em>Gong Lum v. Rice</em>, 1927 (USC upheld segregated public schools for Asians connoting no difference between segregation for blacks to those of the &ldquo;yellow races&rdquo;).</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>1790 Immigration and Naturalization Act revisited</strong></p><ul><li>Held that only &ldquo;free white persons&rdquo; of &ldquo;good moral character&rdquo; could become naturalized citizens. After the Civil War, African Americans who were former slaves, gained official citizenship status.<ul><li><em>Ozawa v.
