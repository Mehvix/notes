<p><strong>Developing Understanding</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This first unit sets the foundation for the course by teaching students how geographers approach the study of places. Students are encouraged to reflect on the ‚Äúwhy of where‚Äù to better understand geographic perspectives. Many other high school courses ask students to read and analyze data, but for this course, students also apply a spatial perspective when reading and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data.
Students learn the ways information from data sources such as maps, tables, charts, satellite images, and infographics informs policy decisions such as voting redistricting or expanding transportation networks. They also learn about how people influence and are influenced by their environment; the resulting impact on topography, natural resources, and climate; and the differences between and consequences of environmental determinism and possibilism.
Finally, students are introduced to the language of geography, learning discipline-specific terminology and applying that language to contemporary, real-world scenarios so they can better study population processes and patterns in the next unit.</p>

<a class=anchor href=#11-introduction-to-maps>#</a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>IMP 1A Geographers use maps and data to depict relationships of time, space, and scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>:
Identify types of maps, the types of information presented in maps, and different kinds of spatial patterns and relationships portrayed in maps.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Knowledge:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Types of maps include reference maps and thematic maps
<ul>
<li>reference maps
<ul>
<li>Serve to display general features of an area</li>
<li>Topographic highway, atlas, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>thematic maps
<ul>
<li>Server to display single type of information</li>
<li>Types:
<ul>
<li>graduated circle
<ul>
<li>size of circle conveys quantitative statistic</li>
<li>Example
<img src=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled.png alt=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled.png></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>dot
<ul>
<li>display pattern, distribution, dispersion of data in an area</li>
<li>Example
<img src=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-1.png alt=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-1.png></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>choropleth
<ul>
<li>display an average value of data in an area</li>
<li>Example
<img src=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-2.png alt=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-2.png></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Types of spatial patterns represented on maps include absolute and relative distance and direction, clustering, dispersal, and elevation.
<ul>
<li>maps are a special form of model that depicts information in two dimensions and usually on paper. A model is a simplified generalization of something in real life</li>
<li>relative distance (scale)
<ul>
<li>Scale: The ratio between the size of an area on a map and he actual size of that same area on the earth&rsquo;s surface</li>
<li>Scale gives a frame of reference</li>
<li>Representation Factor (RF):
<ul>
<li>1 inch : 250,000 feet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Verbal:
<ul>
<li>One inch represents 250,000 feet</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>direction
<ul>
<li>absolute direction:
<ul>
<li>north south, compass</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>relative direction:
<ul>
<li>left right, forward backwards, up down</li>
<li>based on perspective in certain location</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>clustering + dispersal
<ul>
<li>where groups are (not) centered around</li>
<li>density vs concentration:
<ul>
<li>Density is the amount of an object within a certain area</li>
<li>concentration is how these objects are distributed.
<img src=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-3.png alt=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-3.png></li>
<li>Box A the distribution is dispersed.</li>
<li>There is a clear cluster of stars in the upper left corner for Box C.</li>
<li>Box B has concentrations in the left and right sides</li>
<li>Box D has a cluster (though not as clustered as C) in the middle left and one outlier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>elevation
<ul>
<li>Hight from set point, typically water level</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All maps are selective in information; map projections inevitably distort spatial relationships in shape, area, distance, and¬†direction
<ul>
<li>Maps are 1D representations (projection) of a 2D environment, so they&rsquo;ll inherently have distortion</li>
<li>Mercator
<img src=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-4.png alt=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-4.png>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>:
Define major geographic concepts that illustrate spatial relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Knowledge:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Spatial concepts include absolute and relative location, space, place, flows, distance decay, time-space compression, and pattern.
<ul>
<li>location + place (same thing)
<ul>
<li>actual position on earth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>space
<ul>
<li>area that is occupied by something</li>
<li>can refer to physical and cultural objects on the surface of earth</li>
<li>relative space is concerned with where something is in relation to something else and changes constantly as interrelationships between people, places, and things change</li>
<li>absolute space is a measurable area with definite boundaries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>site
<ul>
<li>physical location of a place</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>situation
<ul>
<li>location of a place based on its relation to other places</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>flows + patterns
<ul>
<li>trends of relationships(?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>distance decay
<ul>
<li>The declining degree of acceptance of an idea or innovation with increasing time and distance from its point of origin or source.</li>
<li>Example: The number of phone calls made decreases with distance.</li>
<li>Greater number of migrants settled at the edge of the country closer to the country of origin, compared to the number settled on the opposite edge of the country.</li>
<li>The diminishing evidence of cultural traits by a group of people, if the explanation clearly shows a link to the fact that due to migration there is less contact between the migrants and their home country.</li>
<li>Explanatory factor behind distance decay relationship (e.g., travel cost, information availability).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>time-space compression (decrease in friction of distance)
<ul>
<li>the increasing sense of connectivity that seems to be bringing people closer together even thought their distances are the same.</li>
<li>Space time compression is the solution to distance decay because technology (internet,cell phones) is allowing us to communicate more across longer distances.

<p>SPS 1 Geographers analyze complex issues and relationships with a distinctively spatial perspective</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>:
Describe different ways that geographers define regions.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Knowledge:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Regions are defined on the basis of one or more unifying characteristics or on patterns of activity.
<ul>
<li>A region is an area characterized by similarity or by cohesiveness that sets it apart from other areas.</li>
<li>Regions allow us to generalize about a common characteristic so we can better group them</li>
<li>A region is an area on the earth identified by two common characteristics: physical and political geography.</li>
<li>Physical regions are features such as deserts, mountains, and lakes.</li>
<li>Political regions by establishing political boundaries like the borders of countries.</li>
<li>Some regions are based on culture (language or religion), while physical geography defines others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Types of regions include formal, functional, and perceptual/vernacular
<ol>
<li>Formal (Uniform)
<ul>
<li>Region with high level of consistency in a certain cultural or physical attribute</li>
<li>E.g.
<ul>
<li>Dairying region of North America</li>
<li>Political boundaries</li>
<li>Tropical Regions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Functional (Nodal)
<ul>
<li>A region with a node, sometimes a hearth, surrounded by interconnecting linkages.</li>
<li>Usually connections relate to trade, communication, transportation, etc.</li>
<li>E.g.
<ul>
<li>Cell towers</li>
<li>Newspaper Circulation</li>
<li>School District</li>
<li>Metropolitan Area</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perceptual (Vernacular)
<ul>
<li>A region defined by feelings and prejudices that may or may not be true.</li>
<li>A construct of one&rsquo;s mental map</li>
<li>E.g.
<ul>
<li>Bible belt</li>
<li>South</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Regional boundaries are transitional and often contested and overlapping.
<ul>
<li>Regions of the world can and do overlap such as the areas of Southeast Asia and Asia. Regions also have transitional boundaries like between North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Geographers apply regional analysis at local, national, and global scales
<ul>
<li>There is not total agreement, however, among geographers on how all regions are defined.
<ul>
<li>One geographer may place Chad in the region of North Africa, and another would classify Chad as part of Central Africa.</li>
<li>Geographers will also use two different terms to describe the same area; the Middle East and Southwest Asia, for example.</li>

<a class=anchor href=#-unit-2--population-and-migration-patterns-and-processes>#</a>
</h1>
<p><strong>Developing Understanding</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This unit addresses the patterns associated with human populations. Populations may increase or decrease as a result of a combination of natural changes (births and deaths) and migration patterns (emigration and immigration). Students examine population distributions at different scales‚Äîlocal, national, regional, and global. Population pyramids demonstrate age-sex structures, revealing the growth or decline of generations and allowing geographers to predict economic needs based on reproductive and aging patterns.
Students learn about factors that influence changes in population as well as the long- and short-term effects of those population changes on a place‚Äôs economy, culture, and politics. For example, environmental degradation and natural hazards may prompt population redistribution at various scales, which in turn creates new pressures on the environment and on cultural, economic, and political institutions. The study of migration patterns allows students to examine factors contributing to voluntary and forced relocation and the impact of these migrating populations on existing settlements.
Combined, the concepts and theories encountered in this unit help students develop connections and transfer their learning in upcoming units to course topics such as cultural patterns, the political organization of space, food production issues, natural resource use, and urban systems.</p>

<p>IMP-2 Changes in population are due to mortality, fertility, and migration, which are influenced by the interplay of environmental, economic, cultural, and political factors.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>:
Explain theories of population growth and decline.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Knowledge:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Malthusian theory and its critiques are used to analyze population change and its consequences.
<ul>
<li>Thomas Malthus - proposed in his Essay on the Principle of Population 1798, that the population grows faster than the food supply. He claimed that while population expanded at a geometric or <strong>exponential rate</strong>, food supply increased <strong>arithmetically or linearly</strong>.</li>
<li>However, the continued evolution of agriculture has continued to provide the world with an adequate amount of food. <strong>The problem now is distribution of food, not the actual production of it.</strong> Also, the birth rates declined sharply in the latter part of the 20th century, thus the world population expanded to only 6 billion compared to Malthus‚Äôs predicted 10.

<img src=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-25.png alt=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-25.png></li>
<li>Neo-Malthusians
<ul>
<li><strong>claim that more LDC‚Äôs are in stage 2 of the demographic transition than ever before in history, thus putting a larger strain on the food supply.</strong> They also modified Malthus‚Äôs theory by stating that the <strong>population growth is out-stripping not just food production, but a wide variety of resources, such as oil, natural gas, etc.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Critics of Malthus</strong>
<ul>
<li>claim that population growth stimulates new technology and that as strain is put on any resource, the inventive human being will simply develop an alternative method once it is economically feasible.</li>

<li><strong>Essential Knowledge:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Types of population policies include those that promote or discourage population growth, such as pronatalist, antinatalist, and immigration policies.
<ul>
<li>countries fearing overpopulation may enact Antinatilist policies, e.g. China&rsquo;s child limit</li>
<li>countries fearing dipping below the replacement level, to assure the population continues to replace itself, may enact pronatilist policies, e.g. Scandinavian country&rsquo;s proactive ads, or policy encourage immigration (migration in to the country)</li>

<li><strong>Essential Knowledge:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Changing social values and access to education, employment, health care, and contraception have reduced fertility rates in most parts of the world.
<ul>
<li>social:
<ul>
<li>women have a say in whether or not they want a child</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>economic:
<ul>
<li>women joining the workforce leaves less time for relationships</li>

<img src=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-26.png alt=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-26.png></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changing social, economic, and political roles for females have influenced patterns of fertility, mortality, and migration, as illustrated by Ravenstein‚Äôs laws of migration.
<ul>
<li>Ravenstein&rsquo;s Laws:
<ol>
<li>Most migrants move only a short distance.</li>
<li>Migration proceeds step by step. There is a process of absorption, whereby people immediately surrounding a rapidly growing town move into it and the gaps they leave are filled by migrants from more distant areas, and so on until the attractive force is spent.</li>
<li>Migrants going long distances generally go by preference to one of the great centres of commerce or industry.</li>
<li>Each current of migration produces a compensating counter-current.</li>
<li>Natives of towns are less migratory than those of rural areas</li>
<li>Females are more migratory than males within the kingdom of their birth, but males more frequently venture beyond.</li>
<li>Most migrants are adults: families rarely migrate out of their country of birth.</li>
<li>Large towns grow more by migration than by natural increase.</li>
<li>Migration increases in volume as industries and commerce develop and transport improves.</li>
<li>The major direction of migration is from the agricultural areas to the centres of industry and commerce.</li>
<li>The major causes of migration are economic.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Ravensteins laws aren&rsquo;t scientific</li>
<li>Are too specificied
<ul>
<li>E.g. short distance occurs in Africa where most migrations is due to wars, while most migration from China is to the US (long)</li>

</li>
<li>Why population is aging

‚ö±Ô∏è Unit 3 - Cultural Patterns and Processes
<a class=anchor href=#-unit-3---cultural-patterns-and-processes>#</a>
</h1>
<p><strong>Developing Understanding</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main focus of this unit is on cultural patterns and processes that create recognized cultural identities. Students consider the physical environment to determine the effects of geographical location and available resources on cultural practices. Visuals representing artifacts, mentifacts and sociofacts all shed light on cultural landscapes and how they change over time. Practice in analyzing images of different places at different times for evidence of their ethnicity, language, religion, gender roles and attitudes, and other cultural attributes builds students‚Äô understanding of cultural patterns and processes.
This unit also considers from a temporal and spatial perspective how culture spreads, through traditional forces such as colonialism and imperialism and through contemporary influences such as social media. Rather than emphasize the details of cultural practices associated with specific languages and religions, this unit instead focuses on the distribution of cultural practices and on the causes and effects of their diffusion. For example, students might study the distribution of Chinese versus English languages or the diffusion patterns of religions such as Hinduism and Islam, at local, national, or global scales.
An understanding of the diffusion of cultural practices provides a foundation for the study of political patterns and processes in the next unit</p>

<li>Language families, languages, dialects, world religions, ethnic cultures, and gender roles diffuse from cultural hearths.</li>
<li>Diffusion of language families, including Indo-European, and religious patterns and distributions can be visually represented on maps, in charts and toponyms, and in other representations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Religion
<img src=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-56.png alt=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-56.png>
<ol>
<li>Hinduism
<ol>
<li>Hearth: Pakistan in ~2300 BCE</li>
<li>Because Hinduism is an ethnic religion it primarily diffused via relocation diffusion to India and Nepal</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Judaism
<ol>
<li>Hearth: Isreal/Palestine in ~1800 BCE</li>
<li>Due to persecution from many countries, Judaism has diffused across many countries but is most prominent in Isreal and the United States now.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Christianity
<ol>
<li>Hearth: Jerusalem on 1 AD</li>
<li>Christianity largely spread due to conquest throughout much of the Roman Empire, and again later on through colonialism. Now it‚Äôs the most practiced religion and is most influential in Europe, the Americas, South Africa, and Australia</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Islam
<ol>
<li>Hearth: Arabian Peninsula/Saudi Arabia in ~600 CE</li>
<li>Spread via conquest and trade, concentrated primarily in the Middle East, North Africa, Southwest Asia, and some portions of Southeast Asia</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Buddhism
<ol>
<li>Hearth: Nepal in ~500 BCE</li>
<li>Missionaries and trade helped diffuse Buddhism, and it‚Äôs not found in Southeast and East Asia, India, Sri Lanka, and Tibet</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Religion can identify, unit, or divide a group of people
<ul>
<li><strong>RELIGION IS ARGUABLY THE MOST VOLITALE OF ALL HUMAN RELATIONS AND THE SOURCE OF MOST VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT HISTORY.</strong></li>
<li>EUnion forbid any religious symbols such as crucifixes, crosses, etc. on public school walls and calls them a violation of religious and educational freedom</li>
<li>Religion is nearly always suppressed in communist countries. Leaders believe that religion has a tendency to upset stability and therefore ban it altogether, though often they just concrete the people‚Äôs religious adherence instead of destroying it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Religions have distinct places of origin from which they diffused to other locations through different processes. Practices and belief systems impacted how widespread the religion¬†diffused.
<ul>
<li>Romans came and pushed out Jews, forcing them to diffuse</li>
<li>Many religions spread via trade routes
<ul>
<li>Christian countries tended to have many trade routes, so it spread to a range of areas</li>
<li>Islamic countries didn&rsquo;t trade very far outside Africa and Asia (a bit to Europe)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buddhism barely diffused from Asia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Universalizing religions</strong>, including Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Sikhism, are spread through expansion and relocation diffusion.
<ul>
<li>Anyone can become a member of a universalizing religion</li>
<li>universalizing religion stories often attempt to explain the mystical and there calendar&rsquo;s main purpose in calendars is to commemorate events in the founder‚Äôs life, thus the seasons or weather are not central to the structure</li>
<li>Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam are the three main
<ul>
<li>Buddhism and Islam are the universalizing religions that place the most emphasis on identifying shrines/holy places.
<ul>
<li>In universalizing religions, the holy places are generally locations at which memorable events happened in the founder‚Äôs life, such as Mecca is in Islam because it is Muhammad‚Äôs birthplace.</li>
<li>Holy places in ethnic religions are often physical features that are closely tied to the religion (For example, in Hindu one of the most important rituals is the bathing of oneself in the Ganges River.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Members actively proselytize, or seek new converts by sending missionaries through the world to spread their beliefs
<img src=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-57.png alt=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-57.png>
<strong>Excluding Hinduism</strong>, this shows diffusion of universalizing religions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ethnic religions, including Hinduism and Judaism, are generally found near the hearth or spread through relocation diffusion.
<ul>
<li>Only really spread from generation to generation</li>
<li>Ethnic religious creation stories tend to deal with the physical environment and natural events and typically organize their calendars around the seasons, other natural events, or the physical geography</li>
<li>Ethnic religions rarely diffuse, and when they do, it is to a small extent
<ul>
<li>Judaism is an exception in that it has diffused widely throughout the years, mainly because its people have had to flee persecution from many areas in the world.</li>

<p>Developing Understanding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This unit addresses the political organization of the world. Building on knowledge of populations and cultural patterns learned in previous units, students examine the contemporary political map and the impact of territoriality on political power and on issues of identity for peoples. Students also look at the different types of political boundaries, how they function, and their scale, as they consider both internal and international boundaries. The interplay of political and cultural influences may cause tensions over boundaries to arise, such as sovereign states making claims on what other states consider to be international waters.
Students also examine forms of government and how forces such as devolution may alter the functioning of political units and cause changes to established political boundaries. Separatist and independence movements that challenge the sovereignty of political states may arise from economic and nationalistic forces, as seen in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Spain. The influence of supranational organizations such as the United Nations or European Union and their role in global affairs presents another challenge to nationalist sovereignty. Student understanding of cultural patterns and processes helps inform their understanding of the consequences of centrifugal and centripetal forces.</p>

<li><strong>Essential Knowledge:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Political power is expressed geographically as control over people, land, and resources, as illustrated by neocolonialism, shatter belts, and choke points.
<ul>
<li>neocolonialism
<ul>
<li>Refers to the economic control that MDCs are sometimes believed to have over LDCs.</li>
<li>Through organizations such as the IMF, the MDCs are able to dictate precisely what LDCs economic policies are, or are able to use their economic subsidies to put LDCs industries out of business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>shatter belts
<ul>
<li>an area of instability between regions with opposing political and cultural values</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>choke points
<ul>
<li>A geographical land feature such as a valley or water way narrowing causing a decrease in forces making their way through.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Territoriality is the connection of <strong>people</strong>, their¬†<strong>culture</strong>, and their <strong>economic</strong> systems to the land.

<ul>
<li>most of the time are made to not piss people / countries off if made by a supranational org</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Land and maritime boundaries and international agreements can influence national or regional identity and encourage or discourage international or internal interactions and disputes over resources.</li>
<li>The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea defines the rights and responsibilities of nations in the use of international waters, established territorial seas, and <strong>exclusive economic zones</strong>.

</h1>
<p><strong>Developing Understanding</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This unit examines the origins of agriculture and its subsequent diffusion. Students learn about the ways agricultural practices have changed over time as a result of technological innovations, such as equipment mechanization and improvements in transportation that create global markets. In addition, they examine the consequences of agricultural practices such as the use of high-yield seeds and chemicals, revisiting the human‚Äìenvironmental relationships studied in Unit 1.
Course emphasis on spatial patterns is evident in this unit as students consider the differences in what foods or resources are produced and where they are produced. These agricultural production regions are impacted by economic and technological forces that increase the size of agricultural operations and the carrying capacity of the land. This has in turn created a global system of agriculture and the interdependence of regions of agricultural consumption and production.
Student understanding of this global system of agriculture based on government cooperation lays the foundation for a deeper understanding of economic development in the final unit of the course.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>:
Explain the connection between physical geography and agricultural practices.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Knowledge:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Agricultural practices are influenced by the physical environment and climatic conditions, such as the Mediterranean climate and tropical climates.
<ul>
<li>During the <strong>First Agricultural Revolution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sarted around 11,000 BC</li>
<li>Unknown origins / how it happened (before recording of history)</li>
<li>Humans radically changed their behavior:</li>
<li>Went from hunting/gather life style to settling in to single areas and cultivating the land, planting crops, and raising animals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agriculture is impacted by:
<ul>
<li>Land ‚Äî cheap, near market + transportation, good quality soil</li>
<li>Labor ‚Äî cheap, skilled (enough), enough quantity</li>
<li>Climate ‚Äî have to meet requirements of crop, enough rain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mediterranean Agriculture:
<ul>
<li>produces grapes and olives (cash crops), alongside citruses and figs ‚Äî helps attract tourists, contributes to culture</li>
<li>still produce cereals, especially wheat for pasta/bread</li>
<li>requires warm year-round climate with lots of sunshine and boardering a sea</li>
<li>horticulture: growing fruits, veggies, and flowers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intensive farming practices include market gardening, plantation agriculture, and mixed crop/livestock systems.
<ul>
<li>Land: Small ‚Äî land isn&rsquo;t cheap so only small portions of high quality land is used</li>
<li>High yield (food produced) to feed consumers</li>
<li>Location: Closest to market</li>
<li>Relies on lots of labor and tech (pesticides, fertilizer, etc.)</li>
<li>(Oftentimes) variety of products produced ‚Äî <strong>polyculture</strong></li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>market gardening
<ul>
<li>close to market</li>
<li>small scale production of cash crops: fruits, vegetables, and flowers (apples, asparagus, cherries, lettuce, mushrooms, tomatoes)</li>
<li>sold directly to local consumers.</li>
<li>truck farming: truck means &ldquo;barter&rdquo; or &ldquo;exchange&rdquo;, <strong>not a physical truck</strong></li>

<li>plantation agriculture (cash crop, cashcrop)
<ul>
<li>highly efficient</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>mixed crop/livestock systems
<ul>
<li>Both animal and crops are farmed in the same area.</li>
<li>Most common form of agriculture in US</li>
<li>Crops, like maize and soybeans, are grown primarily to feed animals</li>
<li>Utilizes crop rotation: cycles various crops and fields left to fallow (naturally grow over) to allow nutrient replenishing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>China, India, and SE Asia rely on this type of agriculure to <strong>double-crop</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fit 2 years of harvest in 1 year</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extensive farming practices include shifting cultivation, nomadic herding, and ranching.
<ul>
<li>Land: Large</li>
<li>Location: Farther from market ‚Äî land isn&rsquo;t cheap so it&rsquo;s not that great and far away from market</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>:
Identify different rural settlement patterns and methods of surveying rural settlements.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Knowledge:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Specific agricultural practices shape different rural land-use patterns.
<ul>
<li>Rural defined as &lt; 2500 residents, and between 1 and 999 person per square mile</li>
<li>3 factors that affect the pattern of rural setllement:
<ol>
<li>The kind of resource/feature that attracts people to the area (forests, farmlands, fields)</li>
<li>The transportation method avaliable at the time of settlement (rivers, roads)</li>
<li>Role of government policy, especially the land survey system (metes-and-bonds, long lot, rectangle, etc.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rural settlement patterns are classified as clustered, dispersed, or linear.
<ul>
<li>clustered
<ul>
<li>A clustered rural settlement typically includes homes, barns, tool
sheds, and other farm structures, plus personal services, such as
religious structures and schools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>dispersed
<ul>
<li>characterized by farmers living on individual farms isolated from neighbors rather than alongside other farmers in the area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>linear
<ul>
<li>Linear rural settlements feature buildings clustered along a road, river, or dike to facilitate communications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nucleated
<ul>
<li>a number of families live in close proximity to each other, with fields surrounding the collection of houses and farm buildings (e.g., Asian longhouse)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rural survey methods include metes and bounds, township and range, and long lot.
<ul>
<li>Rectangular survey system
<ul>
<li>Also called the Public Land Survey</li>
<li>The system was used by the U.S. Land Office Survey to parcel land west of the Appalacian mountains.</li>
<li>The system divides land into a series of rectangular parcels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>metes and bounds
<ul>
<li>A system of land surveying east of the Appalachian Mountains (EU)</li>
<li>It is a system that relies on descriptions of land ownership and <strong>natural features</strong> such as streams or trees.

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Objective</strong>:
Explain how economic forces influence agricultural practices</li>
<li><strong>Essential Knowledge:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Agricultural production regions are defined by the extent to which they reflect subsistence or commercial practices (monocropping or monoculture).
<ul>
<li>Subsistence vs Commercial:
<img src=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-86.png alt=/docs/ap/huge/Untitled-86.png>
<ul>
<li>Subsistence is :
<ul>
<li>Food grown for the farmer or farmer‚Äôs family/kin</li>
<li>Food grown for local consumption for village/community market</li>
<li>Food NOT grown for commercial purposes/sold for revenue</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Monocropping</strong> or <strong>Monoculture</strong> ‚Äî cultivation of a single crop</li>
<li>Occurs in mostly commercial farms in MDCs ‚Äî US in 1950&rsquo;s</li>
<li>minimizes risks ‚Äî climate, cost of inputs like labor or fertilizer, market demand, etc.</li>
<li>maximize profits ‚Äî choice of crop best suited for growing, potential pricing, etc.
<ul>
<li>Supply and demands influences farmers to raise the crops that have high demands</li>
<li>Governments disort market influence by subsidizing certain crops (rice in Japan, milk in US)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intensive and extensive farming practices are determined in part by land costs (bid-rent theory).
<ul>
<li><strong>bid-rent:</strong> geographical economic theory: refers to how the price and demand on real estate changes as the distance towards the Central Business District (CBD) increases.</li>
<li><strong>intensive agriculture:</strong> any kind of agriculture activity that involves <strong>effective and efficient use of labor</strong> on <strong>small plots of land</strong> to <strong>maximize crop yield</strong></li>
<li><strong>extensive agriculture:</strong> an agricultural system characterized by <strong>low inputs of labor</strong> per unit land area
