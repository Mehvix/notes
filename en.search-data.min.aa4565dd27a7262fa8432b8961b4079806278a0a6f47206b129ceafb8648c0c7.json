Second, check if they intersect by setting the two parametric equations equal to one another:  .$x_1 + t a_1 = x_2 + s a_2; y_1 + t b_1 = y_2 + s b_2; z_1 + t c_1 = z_2 + s c_2$ If an equation exists (that is, there is a valid .$t$ and .$s$) then they intersect at .$L_1(t)$ or .$L_2(s)$     Intersection line .$L$ of two planes  Set one of the 3D variables to zero (e.x. .$z=0$) to find where the two planes intersect the remaining plane (in this case the .$z$ plane) We find the intersection point .$P (\\alpha, \\beta, 0)$ by solving when our plane equations in the prior equation are equal Since the line .$L$ is orthogonal to both planes' normal vectors, our direction vector is .$\\vec v = n_1 \\times n_2 = \\langle a,b,c \\rangle$ We can then plug in everything into the symmetric equation: .$\\frac{x-\\alpha}{a} = \\frac{y-\\beta}{b} = \\frac{z-0}{c}$   Distance from point to plane  Given point .$P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and plane .$ax+by+cz+d=0$ $$D = \\Vert \\text{comp}_{\\vec n}{\\vec b} \\Vert = \\frac{\\vert ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 +d\\vert}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}$$   Distance from skew line to skew line  Given .$L_1 = \\langle x_1, y_1, z_1 \\rangle + t \\vec v_1$ and .$L_2 = \u0026hellip;$   Find the plane containing .$L_2$ that is parallel to .$L_1$. .$P_3 = \\langle x- x_2, y - y_2, z - z_2 \\rangle \\cdot (v_1 \\times v_2)$ Find the .$D$istance from .$x_1, y_1, z_1$ on .$L_1$ to the plane .$P_3$ above $$D = \\frac{\\vert a_3 x_1 + b_3 y_1 + c_3 z_1 +d\\vert}{\\sqrt{a_3^2 + b_3^2 + c_3^2}}$$   Distance from point to line  Given line .$L = \\langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \\rangle + \\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ and point .$P = \\langle P_x, P_y, P_z \\rangle$   Write a distance equation as .$D^2 = ((x_0 + ta) - P_x)^2 + ((y_0 + tb) - P_y)^2 + ((z_0 + tc) - P_z)^2$ Find the minimum value of .$t$ and plug in into the equation above and find .$D$ (but not .$D^2$!)    12.6 Cylinders and Quadratic Surfaces #  Traces #    Cross sections of a surface found by taking a three-variable equation and setting one of the equations variables equal to a constant.

This can be graphed with a dotted line following the curve .$x = y^2$   For the equation .$z = f(x,y)$, .$x,y$ are the independent variables and .$z$ is the dependent variable \u0026ndash; similar to single variable equations We can visualize functions of two variables (i.e .$f(x,y)$) by graphing them in 3D as .$(x,y,f(x,y))$  We can then write level curves for the function by setting .$f(x,y) = k$ for some .$k$onstant in the range of .$f$. This will result in a graph similar to a Topographic map Level Curve: The level curves of a function .$f$ of two variables are the curves with equations .$f(x,y) = k$, where .$k$ is a constant (in the range of .$f$).      14.2 Limits and Continuity #  Limits #   Vector Limit: Let .$f$ be a function of two variables whose domain .$D$ includes points arbitrarily close to .$(a, b)$. Then we say that the limit of .$f(x, y)$ as .$(x, y)$ approaches .$a, b.$ is .$L$ and we write $$\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)} f(x,y) = L$$ if for every number .$\\varepsilon \u0026lt; 0$ there is a corresponding number .$\\delta \u0026lt; 0$ such that if .$(x, y) \\in D$ and .$0 \u0026lt; \\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2} \u0026lt; \\delta$ then .$\\vert f(x,y) - L \\vert \u0026lt; \\varepsilon$   Notice that .$\\vert f(x,y) - L \\vert$ is the distance between the numbers .$f(x, y)$ and .$L$, and .$\\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2}$ is the distance between the point .$(x, y)$ and the point .$(a, b)$. If .$f(x,y) \\to L_1$ as .$(x,y) \\to (a,b)$ along a path .$C_1$ and .$f(x,y) \\to L_2$ as .$(x,y) \\to (a,b)$ along a path .$C_2$, where .$L_1 \\neq L_2$, then .$\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)} f(x,y)$, does not exist.  We can test this by setting .$x$ and .$y$ to various different values (e.x. .$x=0, y=0, x=y, \u0026hellip;,$ etc)    Continuity #  A function .$f$ of two variables is called continuous at .$(a,b)$ if $$\\lim_{(x,y)\\to (a,b)} f(x,y) = f(a,b)$$ We say .$f$ is continuous on .$D$ if .$f$ is continuous at every point .$(a,b)$ in .$D$.   That is, we need the limit to exist ands for .$f(a,b)$ to be defined Continuous functions: .$x,y, c, \\text{ trig (on domain)}$ Arithmetic, composition, exponent all preserve continuity (on domain!) Dividing doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily preserve continuity  14.3 Partial Derivatives #  If .$f$ is a function of two variables, its partial derivatives are the functions .$f_x$ and .$f_y$ defined by $$f_x(x,y) = \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x} = \\lim_{h\\to0} \\frac{f(x+h,y)-f(x,y)}{h}$$ $$f_y(x,y) = \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta y} = \\lim_{h\\to0} \\frac{f(x,y+h)-f(x,y)}{h}$$   Notice we use .$\\delta$ instead of .$d$ for partial derivatives These can be written at a single point .$(a,b)$ with respect to .$x$ and .$y$ by treating the remaining variables as a constant $$f_x(a,b) = g'(a); \\ \\ \\ g(x) = f(x,b)$$ $$f_y(a,b) = h'(b); \\ \\ \\ h(y) = f(a,y)$$ Which can be extrapolated for 3 (or more) variables: $$f_z(a,b,c) = k'(c); \\ \\ \\ k(z) = f(a,b,z)$$  Higher Derivatives #   Just like regular derivatives, we can do many partial derivatives For example, the following are second partial derivatives of .$z=f(x,y)$: $$(f_x)_x = f_{xx} = \\frac{\\delta }{\\delta x}\\bigg(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x}\\bigg) = \\frac{\\delta^2f}{\\delta x^2}$$ $$(f_x)_y = f_{xy} = \\frac{\\delta }{\\delta y}\\bigg(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x}\\bigg) = \\frac{\\delta^2f}{\\delta y \\delta x}$$ $$(f_y)_x = f_{yx} = \\frac{\\delta }{\\delta x}\\bigg(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta y}\\bigg) = \\frac{\\delta^2f}{\\delta x \\delta y}$$ $$(f_y)_y = f_{yy} = \\frac{\\delta }{\\delta y}\\bigg(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta y}\\bigg) = \\frac{\\delta^2f}{\\delta y^2}$$  Clairaut‚Äôs Theorem Suppose .$f$ is defined on a disk .$D$ that contains the point .$(a,b)$. If the functions .$f_{xy}$ and .$f_{yx}$ are both continuous on .$D$, then $$f_{xy}(a,b) = f_{yx}(a,b)$$  Partial Differential Equations #   In the sciences, we typically want to find how a system changes with respect to multiple variables Partial derivatives occur in partial differential equations, e.x Laplace\u0026rsquo;s Equation: $$ \\frac{\\delta^2 u}{\\delta x^2} + \\frac{\\delta^2 u}{\\delta y^2} = 0$$  Solutions to Laplace\u0026rsquo;s are always harmonic functions, such as .$u=e^x \\sin(y)$    14.4 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations #  Tangent Planes #   Tangent planes are to surfaces as tangent lines are to curves  Tangent planes contain both the partial derivative lines w.r.t .$x$ and .$y$   All we need to know to write a tangent plane is a point .$(a,b)$ and direction of the two partial derivatives .$\\langle 1,0, f_x(a,b)\\rangle, \\langle 0,1, f_y(a,b)\\rangle$  Direction vector can be found with .$\\langle 1,0, f_x(a,b)\\rangle \\times \\langle 0,1, f_y(a,b)\\rangle = \\langle -f_x, -f_y, 1 \\rangle$ which we can dot with .$\\langle x-x_0, y-y_0, z-f(x_0,y_0) \\rangle$ Suppose .$f$ has continuous partial derivatives. An equation of the tangent plane to the surface .$z = f(x, y)$ at the point .$P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is $$z-f(x_0, y_0) = f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y-y_0)$$      Linear Approximations #   As we get very close to the surface, then the tangent plane (at point .$(a,b)$) looks more and more like the surface  Thus, we can use it to for making approximations when we are near near .$(a,b)$ If .$z=f(x,y)$, then .$f$ is differentiable at .$(a,b)$ if .$\\Delta z$ can be expressed in the form $$\\Delta z = f_x(a,b)\\Delta x + f_y(a,b)\\Delta y + \\varepsilon_1 \\Delta x + \\varepsilon_2 \\Delta y$$ where the error terms, .$\\varepsilon_1$ and .$\\varepsilon_2 \\to 0$ as .$(\\Delta x, \\Delta y) \\to (0,0)$ and the other terms are the linearization of the function.     Rewriting this, we can use the given .$f(x,y)$ to write the linear approximation which is an estimate for point/state at .$f(a,b)$ $$f(x,y) \\approx f(a,b) + f_x(a,b) (x-a) + f_y(a,b)(y-b)$$ We can similarly define the 3D linear approximation, increment of .$w$, and differential .$dw$ as: $$f(x,y,z) \\approx f(a,b,c) + f_x(a,b,c) (x-a) + f_y(a,b,c)(y-b) + f_z(a,b,c) (z-c)$$ $$\\Delta w = f(x+\\Delta x, y + \\Delta y, z + \\Delta z) - f(x,y,z)$$ $$dw = \\frac{\\delta w}{\\delta x}dx + \\frac{\\delta w}{\\delta y}dy + \\frac{\\delta w}{\\delta z}dz$$  Differentials #   With one variable functions, i.e. .$y=f(x)$, we defined the differential .$dx$ to be independent so we had to write .$dy$ as .$dy = f'(x)\\ dx$ Given a differentiable function of two variables, i.e. .$z=f(x,y)$, we know both .$dx$ and .$dy$ are independent so we write: $$dz = f_x(x,y)\\ dx + f_y(x,y)\\ dy = \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta x}dx + \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta y}dy$$ If the partial derivatives .$f_x$ and .$f_y$ exist near .$(a,b)$ and are continuous at .$(a,b)$, then .$f$ is differentiable at .$(a,b)$.  14.5 Chain Rule #  Chain Rule #  Suppose that .$z=f(g_1 (x_1,_{\\dots}, x_m), g_2 (x_1,_{\\dots}, x_m), g_n (x_1,_{\\dots}, x_m))$ is a differentiable function of the .$n$ variables .$g_1,_{\\dots}, g_n$ and is .$g_j$ is a differentiable function of the .$m$ variables .$x_1,_{\\dots}, x_m$. Then .$z$ is a function of .$x_1,_{\\dots}, x_m$ and $$ \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x_i} = \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta g_1} \\frac{\\delta g_1}{\\delta x_i} + \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta g_2} \\frac{\\delta g_2}{\\delta x_i} + \\dots + \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta g_m} \\frac{\\delta g_m}{\\delta x_i}$$ for each .$i= 1,2,\\dots,m$  Implicit Differentiation #    If .$F(x,y) = 0$ defines .$y$ implicitly as a function of .$x$ (that is, .$y = f(x)$, where .$F(x,f(x))=0$ for all .$x$ in the domain of .$f$), then $$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = - \\frac{\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta x}}{ \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta y}} = - \\frac{F_x}{F_y}$$\n  If .$F(x,y,z) = 0$ defines .$z$ implicitly as a function of .$x,y$, then\n  $$ \\frac{dz}{dx} = - \\frac{\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta x}}{ \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta z}} = - \\frac{F_x}{F_z};\\ \\ \\frac{dz}{dy} = - \\frac{\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta y}}{ \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta z}} = - \\frac{F_y}{F_z}$$\n14.6 Directional Derivatives and the Gradient Vector #  Directional Derivatives #  Direction Derivative For function .$f$ at .$(x_0, y_0)$ in the direction of unit vector .$\\hat u = \\langle a, b \\rangle$ is $$D_{\\hat u} f(x_0, y_0) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0 + ha, y_0 + hb) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h} = $$ $$\\dots = \\nabla f \\cdot \\hat u = f_x (x,y) a + f_y (x,y) b$$ if the limit exists (for the former) and if .$f$ is a differentiable function of .$x$ and .$y$ (for the latter)   That is, .$\\hat u = \\hat i = \\langle 1, 0 \\rangle$ for .$D_\\hat{i} = f_x$ and .$\\hat u = \\hat j = \\langle 0, 1 \\rangle$ for .$D_\\hat{j} = f_y$ Differentiability is important because it means that as you approach the surface very closely, it looks more and more like the tangent plane. Directional derivatives can be thought of as the slope of the tangent line at a given point This definition can be extrapolated to (three variables/higher dimensions) trivially, shown below with gradient vectors  Gradient Vector #  Gradient: If .$f$ is a function of variable .$x,y,z$, then the gradient of .$f$ is the vector function .$\\nabla f$ defined by $$\\nabla f(x,y,z) = \\big\\langle f_x(x,y,z), f_y (x,y,z), f_z (x,y,z) \\big\\rangle = \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x}\\hat i + \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta y}\\hat j + \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta z}\\hat k$$   We can now use the gradient to re-write our directional derivative equation as $$D_{\\hat u} f(x,y,z,\\dots) = \\nabla f(x,y,z,\\dots) \\cdot \\hat u$$ We can re-write this using the definition of the dot product as $$D_{\\hat u} f(x,y,z,\\dots) = \\Vert \\nabla f \\Vert \\Vert \\hat u \\Vert \\cos\\theta =\\Vert \\nabla f \\Vert \\cos\\theta $$  Maximizing the Directional Derivative #  Suppose .$f$ is a differentiable function of two or three variables. The maximum value of the directional derivatives .$D_\\hat{u} f(\\vec x)$ is .$\\Vert \\nabla f(\\vec x ) \\Vert$ and it occurs when .$\\hat u$ has the same direction as the gradient vector .$\\nabla f(\\vec x)$   We can see from the definition above that since the max of .$\\cos\\theta$ is .$1$ when .$\\theta = 0$, therefore the max of the directional derivative occurs at the same angle (when .$\\hat u$ has the same direction of .$\\nabla f$ ) TL;DR: .$D_\\hat{u} f(\\vec x)$ is maximized if .$\\vec u = \\frac{\\nabla f}{\\Vert \\nabla f \\Vert}\\bigg\\vert_\\vec{p}$ at point .$\\vec p$  Tangent Planes to Level Surfaces #   If .$f(x,y) = k$ is a curve, then .$F(x,y,z) = k$ is a surface Let .$\\vec r(t)$ be a space curve on the surface .$F(x,y,z) = k$  Let .$\\vec r(t_0) = \\langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \\rangle$ for some .$t_0$ (at some time, the space curve passes through some point which is on the surface) We know .$F(\\vec r(t)) = k$, thus, using the chain rule: $$0 = \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta x} \\frac{\\delta x}{\\delta t} + \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta y} \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta t} + \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta z} \\frac{\\delta z}{\\delta t} = \\nabla F(x_0, y_0, z_0) \\cdot (\\vec r(t_0))'$$   The gradient vector at .$P$, .$F(x_0, y_0, z_0)$, is perpendicular to the tangent vector .$\\vec r'(t)$ to any curve .$C$ on .$S$ that passes through .$P$  In English: The direction of the gradient is always perpendicular to the level surface at every point   We can then define the tangent plane to the level surface .$F(x,y,z) = k$ at .$P(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ as the plane that passes through .$P$ and has normal vector .$\\nabla F(x_0, y_0, z_0)$: $$\\nabla F\\big\\vert_{(x_0, y_0, z_0)} \\cdot \\langle x-x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0 \\rangle = 0$$ We can also write this in the symmetric equation form: $$\\frac{x-x_0}{F_x(x_0, y_0, z_0)} = \\frac{y-y_0}{F_y(x_0, y_0, z_0)} = \\frac{z-z_0}{F_z(x_0, y_0, z_0)}$$  14.7 Maximum and Minimum Values #  Critical Points #  A function of two variables has a local maximum at .$(a,b)$ if .$f(x,y) \\leq f(a,b)$ when .$(x,y)$ is near .$(a,b)$ [This means that for .$f(x,y) \\leq f(a,b)$ for all points .$(x,y)$ in some disk with center .$(a,b)$.] The number .$f(a,b)$ is called a local maximum value. If .$f(x,y) \\geq f(a,b)$ when .$(x,y)$ is near .$(a,b)$, then .$f$ has a local minimum at .$(a,b)$ and .$(x,y)$ is a local minimum value.   If the inequalities above hold for all points .$(x,y)$ in the domain of .$f$, then .$f$ has an absolute maximum (or absolute minimum) at .$(a,b)$ If .$f$ has a local maximum or minimum at .$(a,b)$ and the first-order partial derivatives of .$f$ exist there, then .$f_x(a,b) = 0$ and .$f_y(a,b) = 0$.  If the graph of .$f$ has a tangent plane at a local maximum or minimum, then the tangent plane must be horizontal   .$(a,b)$ is a Critical Point of .$f$ if .$f_x(a,b) = 0$ and .$f_y(a,b) = 0$, or if one of these partial derivatives does not exist  Thus, if .$f$ has a local maximum or minimum at .$(a,b)$, then .$(a,b)$ is a critical point of .$f$ In other words, at a critical point, a function could have a local maximum or a local minimum or neither (saddle point).    Second Derivatives Test: Suppose the second partial derivatives of .$f$ are continuous on a disk with center .$(a, b)$, and suppose that .$f_x(a, b) = 0$ and .$f_y(a, b) = 0$ (that is, .$(a, b)$ is a critical point of .$f$ ). Let $$D = D(a, b) = \\begin{vmatrix}f_{xx} \u0026amp; f_{xy}\\\\ f_{yx} \u0026amp; f_{yy}\\end{vmatrix} = f_{xx}(a, b) f_{yy}(a, b) - (f_{xy}(a, b))^2$$\n If .$D \u0026gt; 0$ and .$f_{xx}(a, b) \u0026gt; 0$ (or .$f_{yy}(a, b) \u0026gt; 0$), then .$f(a, b)$ is a local minimum. If .$D \u0026gt; 0$ and .$f_{xx}(a, b) \u0026lt; 0$ (or .$f_{yy}(a, b) \u0026lt; 0$), then .$f(a, b)$ is a local maximum. If .$D \u0026lt; 0$, then .$f(a, b)$ is a saddle point If .$D = 0$, the test gives no information: .$f$ could be any of the above    Note that in the first two tests, it\u0026rsquo;s implied that .$f_{xx}$ and .$f_{yy}$ have the same sign The determinant is a Hessian matrix  Extreme Points #   Just as a closed interval contains its endpoints, a closed set in .$\\mathbb{R}^2$ is one that contains all its boundary points.  For instance, the disk .$D = \\{(x,y) \\vert x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1 \\}$ is a closed set because it contains all of its boundary points (which are the points on the circle .$r=1$) But if even one point on the boundary curve were omitted, the set would not be closed   A bounded set in .$\\mathbb{R}^2$ is one that is contained within some disk \u0026ndash; it is finite in extent     Extreme Value Theorem for Functions of Two Variables: If .$f$ is continuous on a closed, bounded set .$D$ in .$\\mathbb{R}^2$, then .$f$ attains an absolute maximum value .$f(x_1, y_1)$ and an absolute minimum value .$f(x_2, y_2)$ at some points .$(x_1, y_1)$ and .$(x_2, y_2)$ in .$D$.   If .$f$ has an extreme value at .$(x_1, y_1)$, then .$(x_1, y_1)$ is either a critical point of .$f$ or a boundary point of .$d$. To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function .$f$ on a closed, bounded set .$D$:  Find the values of .$f$ at the critical points of .$f$ in .$D$. Find the extreme values of .$f$ on the boundary of .$D$. The largest of the values from steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.    14.8 Lagrange Multipliers #   We use Lagrange Multipliers to find critical points of a surface .$f$ given some constraining surface .$g$ Method of Lagrange Multipliers To find the maximum and minimum values of .$f(x,y,z)$ subject to the constraint .$g(x,y,z) = k$ [assuming that these extreme values exist and .$\\nabla \\neq 0$ on the surface .$g(x,y,z) = k$]:\n Find all values of .$x, y, z$, and .$\\lambda$ such that $$\\nabla f(x,y,z) = \\lambda \\nabla g(x,y,z)$$ $$g(x,y,z) = k$$ Evaluate .$f$ at all the points .$(x, y, z)$ that result from the first step. The largest of these values is the maximum value of .$f$; the smallest is the minimum value of .$f$.    We can decompose the first equation and use the second equation to get $$f_x = \\lambda g_x;\\ \\ f_y = \\lambda g_y;\\ \\ f_z = \\lambda g_z;\\ \\ g(x,y,z) = k$$ Notice we don\u0026rsquo;t care what .$\\lambda$ is, only that it exists  Two Constraints #   We can use Lagrange multipliers for two constraints .$f$ and .$g$ too: $$\\nabla f(x_0, y_0, z_0) = \\lambda \\nabla g(x_0, y_0, z_0) + \\mu \\nabla h(x_0, y_0, z_0)$$ Likewise, we can decompose the equation above to get the following five equations:  $$f_x = \\lambda g_x + \\mu h_x$$ $$f_y = \\lambda g_y + \\mu h_y$$ $$f_z = \\lambda g_z + \\mu h_z$$ $$g(x,y,z) = k$$ $$h(x,y,z) = c$$       "},{"id":4,"href":"/math-53/15/","title":"15: Multiple Integrals","section":"Math 53","content":"15.1 Double Integrals over Rectangles #   We describe closed rectangles in the form .$R = [a,b] \\times [c,b] = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\vert a \\leq x \\leq b, c \\leq y \\leq d\\}$ Then we can write the solid .$S$ that lies above .$R$ as .$S = \\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\vert 0 \\leq z \\leq f(x,y), (x,y) \\in R\\}$ To find the volume of this surface, we take a double integral $$V = \\iint_R f(x,y)\\ dA$$  Fubini‚Äôs Theorem: If .$f$ is continuous on the rectangle .$R = \\{(x,y) \\vert a \\leq x \\leq b, c \\leq y \\leq d\\}$, then $$\\iint_R f(x,y)\\ dA = \\int_a^b \\int_c^d f(x,y)\\ dy\\ dx = \\int_c^d \\int_a^b f(x,y)\\ dx\\ dy$$ More generally, this is true if we assume that .$f$ is bounded on .$R$, .$f$ is discontinuous only on a finite number of smooth curves, and the iterated integrals exist.

The lower curves are not hyperbolas, because the gas is no longer an ideal gas. (b) An expanded portion of the diagram for low temperatures, where the phase can change from a gas to a liquid.   Phase changes can only be explained if we\u0026rsquo;re considering the behavior of a real \u0026ndash; not ideal \u0026ndash; gas  This is because phase changes involve intermolecular bonds which we only factor in when considering real gases   At high enough pressures, gases take up less volume than expected.  This effect is magnified with lower temperatures   At lower temperatures, the .$PE$ attractive forces between particles aren\u0026rsquo;t negligible with respect to .$KE$ At the critical points, (when .$PV$ curve is horizontal) gases may no longer change to liquid under any pressure  This point varies by substance Gas below the critical point is vapor Gas above the critical point is just gas /shrug   Sublimation: When substance changes from solid to gas, skipping liquefaction step     Ideal gases would have a straight line along a .$PV/nRT \\text{ vs } P$ graph Real gases vary don\u0026rsquo;t follow this line and deviate from it proportional to their molecule size and weight (resulting in higher .$a$ and .$b$ values respectively \u0026ndash; see 18.5)  18.4 Vapor, Pressure, and Humidity #  Evaporation #   Molecules in liquid are held tightly together with intermolecular attractive forces (covalent hydrogen bonds) Some molecules may momentarily leave the liquid if their velocity is fast enough  If velocity isn\u0026rsquo;t too large, then the particle will be pulled back to the liquid surface If velocity is large enough, then the particle will break the intermolecular bonds and leave the liquid to enter their gas form  Low probability of occurring     Because .$v_{\\text{particle}} \\propto T$, the .$\\text{evaporation rate} \\propto T$ As fast moving (thus hot) particles leave the liquid, the liquid\u0026rsquo;s temperature decreases  That is, evaporation is a cooling process    Vapor Pressure #   A typical phase diagram. The solid green line applies to most substances; the dashed green line gives the anomalous behavior of water\n Green line = SL Line; transition between solid .$\\iff$ liquid (melting/freezing) Red line = SV; transition between solid .$\\iff$ vapor (sublimation/deposition) Blue line = LV; transition between liquid .$\\iff$ vapor (vaporizing/condensing)    When evaporation particles go from gas to liquid, it\u0026rsquo;s called condensation The number of particles in vapor increases until the rate of particles condensing is equal to the number of particles becoming vapor (equilibrium!)  When this state is reached, the space above the water is considered saturated Pressure of vapor saturation is called (saturated) vapor pressure   Saturated Vapor Pressure varies with the volume of container  If volume above the liquid was reduced, then the density would increase so particles would condense back to liquid Assuming .$T = \\text{constant}$, vapor pressure would stay constant too   Since at high temperatures there are more particles (entering/already in) the vapor phase, higher pressure is required for equilibrium When the volume is large, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that all the liquid evaporates before equilibrium  Boiling #   Boiling occurs when saturated vapor pressure equals external pressure Bubbling forms as temperature approaches boiling temperature  If the pressure in the bubbles are less than the external pressure, the bubbles are crushed Otherwise, bubbles are able to rise to surface   Boiling point is proportional to pressure  Lower pressure = lower temperature required for boiling point    Partial Pressure and Humidity #   In gases composed of multiple other gases, the total pressure is the sum of all partial pressures for each of other sub gas Partial Pressure is the pressure a single gas would exert by itself  The partial pressure of water in the air can be as low as zero and vary up to a maximum equal to the saturated vapor pressure (of water at the given temperature)   Relative Humidity: ratio of partial pressure of water vapor to the saturated vapor pressure at a given temperature $$\\text{Relative Humidity} = \\frac{\\text{partial pressure of }H_2O}{\\text{saturated vapor pressure of }H_2O} \\cdot 100\\%$$ Super Saturation: .$P_{\\text{partial}} \u0026gt; P_{\\text{saturated vapor pressure}}$  Happens when temperature decreases Excess water condenses as dew / mist    18.5 Van der Waals Equation of State #  Microscopic View (molecular) accounts for\n Finite size of molecules (before we assumed separation .$\\gg$ diameter, ignoring density)  Since gas particles aren\u0026rsquo;t negligible in size, we can\u0026rsquo;t use all of our volume Particles are solid spheres that can\u0026rsquo;t get closer than .$2r$ to one another  That means .$V$ is over-estimated: .$V_{\\text{real}} \u0026lt; V_{\\text{ideal}}$ Lower volume mean more collisions, leading to pressure being higher than estimated with the ideal gas law: .$P_{\\text{real}} \u0026gt; P_{\\text{ideal}}$   The unavailable volume due to particles, .$b$, depends on the .$n$umber of moles $$ P(V-nb) = nRT \\Longrightarrow P\\bigg(\\frac{V}{n} - b\\bigg) = RT\\ \\ \\ \\big[\\text{Clausius Equation of State}\\big]$$ Where .$b$ is the volume consumed by 1 mol of gas with the units V/mols   Forces between molecules (before we assumed that forces only played an effect in collisions)  At low .$T$, electric attractive forces aren\u0026rsquo;t 0  Particles towards the edge are slowed down by the other particles attractive forces For that reason, our pressure is lower than estimated with the ideal gas law: .$P_{\\text{real}} \u0026lt; P_{\\text{ideal}}$   On the contrary, with higher temperatures gases appear more ideal because .$KE$ is greater than the intermolecular .$PE$ \u0026ldquo;Slow down\u0026rdquo; is proportional to the gas density Pressure reduced by the following equation where .$n/V$ is the gas density and .$a$ is a constant unique to the gas that measures the attractive forces between particles $$ a\\bigg( \\frac{n}{V}\\bigg)^2$$ .$a \\propto m$ and boiling point because the lower the boiling point, the less energy is required to break the internal bonds     Thus, we can rewrite the ideal gas law with the last two equations as $$ \\bigg(P+ \\frac{a}{(V/n)^2}\\bigg)\\bigg(\\frac{V}{n} - b\\bigg) = RT \\ \\ \\big[\\text{Van der Waals Eq of State}\\big]$$ Note that these equations aren\u0026rsquo;t accurate in all cases, but they\u0026rsquo;re the best generalization we can do and they show the relation With low densities, .$a\\big/(V/n)^2 \\ll P$ and .$b \\ll V/n$ so Van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law  18.6 Mean Free Path #   Molecules bump into each other a lot which slow them down Mean free path: Average distance between collisions is proportional to .$\\rho ^{-1}, r^{-1}$ $$l_m = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\sqrt{2}r^2 (N/V)}$$  18.7 Diffusion #   Particles diffuse from high to low concentrations until equilibrium is reached (when .$\\rho$ is constant throughout) Given a tube with a cross section area .$A$, two concentrations, .$C_1$ and .$C_2$, separated by .$\\Delta x$, we can write the rate of diffusion, .$J$, as $$J = DA \\frac{C_1 - C_2}{\\Delta x} = DA \\frac{dC}{dx} \\ \\ \\text{[Fick\u0026rsquo;s Law]}$$ .$D$ is the diffusion constant  Varies with temperature, viscosity, and particle size    "},{"id":8,"href":"/physics-7b/19/","title":"19: Heat \u0026 First Law of Thermo","section":"Physics 7B","content":"19.1 Heat as Energy Transfer #  Units #   Heat unit is calorie (cal)  The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 celsius $$4.186 \\text{ J} = 1 \\text{ cal}$$   Kilocalorie (kcal, Calorie) is more common  Amount of heat needed to raise 1 kg of water by 1 celsius $$4.186 \\text{ kJ} = 1 \\text{ kcal}$$   British system of units has British thermal units (Btu)  One Btu is the heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 lb of water by 1 Fahrenheit $$1 \\text{ Btu} = 0.252 \\text{ kcal} = 1056 \\text{ J}$$ Gas companies use the unit therm: .$10^5 \\text{ Btu}$    Heat #   Heat is energy transferred from one object to another because of a difference in temperature.  Energy transfers from hot to cold object until equilibrium   The SI units for heat is the joule: this is because heat is a form of energy!  19.2 Internal Energy #   Internal Energy: The sum of all the energy of all the molecules in an object  Sometimes called thermal energy    Difference between Temp, Heat, and Internal Energy #   Temperature is the average kinetic energy of all of the molecules Internal energy is the sum of the energy of all of the molecules  E.x. Two equal-mass iron ingots could the same temperature as a single ingot, but the two would have double the internal energy   Heat refers to the transfer of energy from one object to another due to a difference in temperatures  Direction of transfer depends on temperature, not internal energy E.x. .$50\\text{ g}$ of .$30^\\circ\\text{ C}$ water mixed with .$200 \\text{ g}$ of .$25^\\circ \\text{ C}$ water results with heat transferring from the smaller sample with less internal energy to the larger sample with more internal energy.    Calculating Internal Energy #   Internal energy is the sum of all the translational kinetic energy of the molecules in a monatomic gas  Monatomic: Gas with one atom per molecule   We can re-write this as the average KE per molecule times the total number of molecules, .$N$ $$E_{\\text{int}} = N \\bigg(\\frac{1}{2}m\\bar{v}^2\\bigg) = \\frac{3}{2}Nk_B T = \\frac{3}{2}nRT$$ We can see that internal energy for a monatomic gas depends only on the temperature and number of moles If a gas isn\u0026rsquo;t monatomic, then we need to consider the rotational and vibrational energy of the molecules  Non-monatomic gasses result in a internal energy at a given temperature compared to a monatomic   The internal energy of real gases depends mainly on temperature  There are some exceptions of gases depending on pressure and volume as well   Internal energy of liquids and solids is more complex  It includes electric potential energy of the chemical bonds    19.3 Specific Heat #   Amount of heat required to change the temperature of a material is found with the following: $$\\Delta Q = mc \\Delta T$$ .$c$ specific heat capacity that depends on the material .$[\\text{J}/(\\text{C}^\\circ\\text{ kg})]$ For water at .$15 ^\\circ \\text{ C}$ and constant pressure .$1 \\text{atm}$, .$c = 4168 \\text{ J}/(\\text{C}^\\circ\\text{ kg}) = 1.00 \\text{ kcal}/(\\text{C}^\\circ \\text{ kg})$  .$c$ does vary to some extent with temperature (and slightly pressure), but for small .$\\Delta T$ we can say .$c$ is a constant   Relative to other materials/substances, water has a high specific heat capacity  19.4 Calorimetry #  Types of Systems #   System: Any (set of) object(s) we choose to consider Closed System: Mass is constant, but energy may be exchanged within environment  Isolated: If no energy in any form passes across its boundaries We idealize systems to be closed systems, which is rare in the real world Heat will flow from hot to cold region of system until equilibrium We can assume that no energy is lost; heat lost in one part = heat gained in another part or .$\\Sigma Q = 0$   Open System: Mass and energy may enter/leave  Calorimeter #   Calorimetry: Quantitative measure of heat exchange Calorimeter tend to have insulation so that no heat is exchanged with the surrounding air Often use thermometer to measure change the temperature E.x. a substance sample will be heated up, measured, then quickly placed inside cool water of calorimeter  The heat lost from the sample will be gained by the water and the calorimeter cup Measuring final temperature of the mixture lets us calculate the specific heat   Assume that small masses like the thermometer/stirrer are negligible  19.5 Latent Heat #   Change of Phase: When a material changes from solid to liquid or liquid to gas.  A certain energy is required for a phase change During phase changes, temperature stops increasing and all energy goes into the phase change Latent heat is lost during phase change (often in the form of heat)      Heat of fusion  .$L_F$: Heat required to change .$1.0 \\text{ kg}$ of a substance from solid to liquid state Heat fusion of water is .$79.7 \\text{kcal/kg} = 333 \\text{kJ/kg}$   Heat of Vaporization  .$L_V$: Heat required to change a substance from liquid to vapor phase Heat vaporization is .$539 \\text{kcal/kg} = 2260 \\text{kJ/kg}$   Heat involved in the phase change depends on the mass and latent heat: $$\\Delta Q = mL$$ Therefore, when considering the change in a system involving heating a substance to a phase change (e.g. boiling at temperature .$T$), we can write: $$\\Delta Q_{\\text{total}} = m_L c \\Delta T + m_S L$$  .$m_L$ is the total mass of the substance before the phase change (e.x. initial mass of substance, don\u0026rsquo;t subtract amount that vaporized) .$m_S$ is the mass of the substance that underwent a phase change (e.x. mass that vaporized)    Evaporation #   Heat of Vaporization of water increases slightly with a decrease in Temperature At .$20^\\circ \\text{ C}$, it\u0026rsquo;s .$585 \\text{ kcal/kg}$ When liquid evaporates, the remaining liquid cools because the heat/energy comes from the water itself Therefore, internal energy decreases with evaporation  Kinetic Theory of Latent Heats #   At melting point, the latent heat of fusion doesn\u0026rsquo;t increase the average KE / temperature Rather, the energy goes into overcoming the PE associated with the forces between the molecules  Once the molecules in a solid are broken from there lattice formation, they can freely roll over one another as a liquid   More energy is required for liquid to gas phase because the average distance between the molecules is greatly increased  The larger the distance that the molecules have to be separated, the more work has to be done to pull them apart    19.6 First Law of Thermo #   Heat and work are different  Heat is the transfer of energy due to a difference in temperature \u0026ndash; hot/cold bath around gas chamber Work is the transfer of energy not due to a temperature difference \u0026ndash; piston applying force to a gas   Internal energy and temperature are both proportional to heat and work though with the First law equation: $$\\Delta E_{\\text{int}} = Q - W = E_{\\text{int, 2}} - E_{\\text{int, 1}} \\ \\ \\ \\text{[First Law of Thermo.]}$$ .$Q$ is net heat added to the system  Heat added is .$\\texttt{+}$, heat lost is .$\\texttt{-}$, E.x. gas chamber heated .$\\Longrightarrow$ system gains energy   .$W$ is net work done by the system  Work done by system is .$\\texttt{+}$, work done on the system is .$\\texttt{-}$, E.x. gas expands .$\\Longrightarrow$ system looses energy   .$Q$ and .$W$ are not state variables in that a static state doesn\u0026rsquo;t have \u0026ldquo;heat\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; only when the system changes through thermodynamic process can we measure heat/work.  This is unlike .$P, V, T$ and .$E_{\\text{int}}$ which are state variables (can be measured at all states)   We can also extend the first law to include systems that have KE and PE: $$\\Delta K + \\Delta U + \\Delta E_{\\text{int}} = Q - W = E_{\\text{int, 2}} - E_{\\text{int, 1}}$$  19.7 Thermodynamic Process and the 1st Law #  Isothermal Process (.$\\Delta T = 0$) #    When temperature is constant, .$PV = \\text{constant}$ Each label of points in the graph above represent the systems states (it\u0026rsquo;s pressure and temperatures) Isotherms: curves in PV diagram  At a lower temperature, an isothermal process would be represented by the isotherm .$A\u0026rsquo;B'$   We also assume that the container is a heat reservoir: a body whose mass is so big that the temperature doesn\u0026rsquo;t change when heat is exchanged We increase internal energy by doing work, such as by decreasing the volume of the container with by applying a force to a piston over some distance  We assume that expansion/compression is  quasistatic: we decrease the volume slow enough that we can consider it a series of equilibrium states all at the same temperature   E.x. if we started with state .$A$ and added heat .$Q$ to the system, the system would reach point .$B$  If .$T$ remain constant, the volume will expand, both doing work .$W$ on the environment and decreasing the .$P$ We know .$E_\\text{int} = \\frac{3}{2}nR\\Delta T$, and since .$\\Delta T = 0 \\Longrightarrow E_\\text{int} = 0$ Thus, .$E_\\text{int} = Q - W \\Longrightarrow W = Q$    $$$$ $$$$ $$W = \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} P \\ dV$$ $$\u0026hellip; = nRT \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} \\frac{dV}{V}$$ $$\u0026hellip; = nRT \\ln{\\frac{V_B}{V_A}}$$    Adiabatic Process (.$Q = 0$) #    No heat allowed to flow in our out of system. This can happen if\u0026hellip;  Process happens so quickly that heat, a slow process, has no time to flow in/out  E.x. a combustion engine happens quickly it\u0026rsquo;s nearly adiabatic   System is well insulated   If a system experiences an adiabatic process slowly, it will look similar to curve .$AC$ Since .$Q = 0 \\Longrightarrow \\Delta E_\\text{int} = -W$ In a reverse processes represented by .$CA$ (adiabatic compression), work is done on the gas so .$E_\\text{int}$ and .$T$ rise  $$W = \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} P \\ dV$$ $$\u0026hellip; = P_A V_A ^\\gamma \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} \\frac{1}{V^\\gamma}\\ dV$$ $$\u0026hellip; = \\frac{P_A V_A - P_B V_B}{1-\\gamma}$$\n19.9 Adiabatic Expansions #   The .$PV$ curve for adiabatic expansion (.$Q=0$) is slightly less steep than isothermal processes (.$\\Delta T = 0$)  This means that for the same change in volume, the pressure will be greater in adiabatic processes Therefore, the temperature of a gas must drop in adiabatic expansion and rise in adiabatic compression Likewise, if during an adiabatic process the volume increases then the internal energy must decrease   We can relate .$P$ and .$V$ for a quasistatic expansion / compression with $$PV^\\gamma = \\text{[constant] for } \\gamma = \\frac{C_P}{C_V} = 1 + \\frac{R}{C_V}$$ which can also be written as the following (with .$d$ = degrees of freedom) $$T_A^{C_V/R} V_A = T_B^{C_V/R} V_B$$ $$C_P = \\frac{d+2}{2}R$$ $$C_V = \\frac{d}{2}R$$ $$\\gamma = \\frac{d+2}{d}$$  Free Expansion #   A type of adiabatic process where gas is allowed to expand in a volume without doing any work Must be done with insulated containers so that no heat is able to flow in/out; .$Q = 0$ No work is done either because no object is moved; .$W = 0$ Thus, .$\\Delta E_\\text{int} = 0$ and .$\\Delta T = 0$ In reality, we see temperature slightly drops meaning internal energy does depend on pressure or volume as well as temperature.  Isobaric and Isovolumetric (.$\\Delta P = 0, \\Delta V = 0$) #     Isobaric: .$\\Delta P = 0 \\Longrightarrow Q = \\Delta E_\\text{int} + W = \\Delta E_\\text{int} + P\\Delta V$. The heat transferred to the system does work, but also changes the internal energy of the system  Isovolumetric: .$\\Delta V = 0 \\Longrightarrow W = 0 \\Longrightarrow Q = \\Delta E_\\text{int}$. The thermodynamic process is the addition or removal of heat. First law of thermo holds for both of these processes  $$$$ $$$$ $$W_{\\text{Isovol.}} = 0$$ $$W_{\\text{Isobaric}} = \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} P \\ dV$$ $$\u0026hellip; = P \\Delta V$$ $$\u0026hellip; = P_B(V_B - V_A)$$ $$\u0026hellip; = nRT_B(1 - \\frac{V_A}{V_B})$$     Work done in volume changes (.$\\Delta V \\neq 0$) #   For quasistatic processes: $$dW = \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = PA d\\vec{l} = P\\ dV \\ \\ \\ \\text{(1)}$$ $$W = \\int dW = \\int_{V_A}^{V_B} P\\ dV \\ \\ \\ \\text{(2)}$$ .$\\text{(1)}$ Where .$F = PA$ is the force the gas exerts on the piston and .$d\\vec{l}$ is the (small) distance the piston moves .$\\text{(2)}$ This shows that the work done is the area under the .$PV$ curve  This equations are valid for work done in any volume change (solid, liquids, gas)   .$W$ (and even .$Q$) depends on the initial and final states and also on the process (or path)  19.8 Molar Specific Heats for Gases and Equipartition of Energy #  Molar Specific Heat #   Specific heat for gases depends heavily on the process and how it\u0026rsquo;s carried out Specific heat for constant pressure and constant volume vary We use molar specific heat for gases: .$C_V$ and .$C_P$ which are defined as the heat required to raise .$1 \\text{ mol}$ of gas by .$1^\\circ \\text{ C}$ at a constant volume or pressure respectively. We then use .$n$ instead of .$m$ in our heat equations: $$\\Delta Q = nC_V \\Delta T = mc_V \\Delta T\\ \\ \\ \\text{[Constant Volume]}$$ $$\\Delta Q = nC_P \\Delta T = mc_P \\Delta T\\ \\ \\ \\text{[Constant Pressure]}$$ which we can then relate to the specific heat with .$M$ as the molecular mass of the gas, .$m/n$ in grams/mol: $$C_V = Mc_V$$ $$C_p = Mc_p$$ In a heating process, when .$\\Delta V = 0$ then the heat added, .$Q_V$ goes entirely into internal energy: .$Q_V = \\Delta E_\\text{int}$ However, when pressure is constant work is done. Thus, heat added, .$Q_P$, goes towards increasing internal energy and work: .$W=P\\Delta V$  Therefore, more heat is needed for a constant pressure system: .$Q_P = \\Delta E_\\text{int} + P\\Delta V$   Since .$\\Delta E_\\text{int}$ is the same for both processes, we can write .$Q_P - Q_V = P \\Delta V$  With an ideal gas, we know .$V = nRT/P$ so .$\\Delta V = nR\\Delta T/P$ which we can combine with the prior equations to get: $$nC_P\\Delta T - nC_V \\Delta T = P\\bigg(\\frac{nR\\Delta T}{P}\\bigg) \\Longrightarrow C_P - C_V = R$$   We can also relate internal energy to molar specific heat for gases at constant volumes: $$\\Delta E_\\text{int} = Q_V \\Longrightarrow \\frac{\\text{[Deg. of Freedom]}}{2}nRT = nC_V\\Delta T \\Longrightarrow C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$$ We can then plug in our new value for .$C_V$ into the second to last equation .$C_P - C_V = R$ to get .$C_P = \\frac{5}{2}R$ for a monatomic gas. We can also combine our equations to write a relation between internal energy and temperature again: $$\\Delta E_\\text{int} = nC_V \\Delta T$$  Equipartition of Energy #    Degrees of Freedom: The number of independent ways a molecule can posses energy  Degrees of freedom depend on the temperature At low temperatures, the only degree of freedom is from translational .$KE$  Starting after .$0K$ Diatomic gas: .$C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$ (3 for each axis) Sum of .$\\frac{1}{2}m \\langle v_x, v_y, v_z \\rangle$   At \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; temperatures, the molecules posses rotation energy  Around .$50K$ Diatomic gas: .$C_V = \\frac{5}{2}R$ Sum of .$\\frac{1}{2}I \\langle 0, \\omega_y, \\omega_z \\rangle$ (since it\u0026rsquo;s rotating about .$\\hat x$ meaning .$E_{\\text{rotational, }x}) = 0$   At higher temperatures, the molecules gain energy associated with their vibrations:  Around .$1000K$ One from KE of the molecules vibrating back and forth: .$\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\text{COM}}^2$ The second from PE of the vibrational motion (think of this as a spring\u0026rsquo;s PE): .$\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$   Solids:  The molar temperature of solids at high temperatures is close to .$3R$. At high temperatures, there are six degrees of freedom: three from vibrational KE in the .$x, y,$ and .$z$ axis and three more from spring PE in the same axis Some of these degrees of freedom aren\u0026rsquo;t active at lower temperatures     Principle of Equipartition of Energy: Energy is shared equally among degrees of freedom and each degrees has energy .$\\frac{1}{2}k_B T$  Thus, for a particle with three degrees of freedom (such as a monatomic gas) .$C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$ Diatomic gases have five degrees so they have .$C_V = \\frac{5}{2}R = 4.97 \\text{ cal/(mol K)}$ and have .$E_\\text{int} = N(\\frac{5}{2}k_B T) = n C_V \\Delta T = \\frac{5}{2}nRT$ where .$n$ is the number of moles and .$N$ is the number of molecules    19.10 Heat Transfer #  Conduction #   Heat transfer by contact Conduction can be visualized thinking of molecular collisions  The hot end of an object has fast moving molecules These molecules bump into other molecules, transferring them some of their own KE This keeps repeating down the object   Free electrons are the primary source of these collisions Heat conduction only occurs when there is a difference in temperatures Heat conduction rate is proportional to the difference in temperatures: $$\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t} = - kA\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{l}$$ Where .$A$ is the cross section area, .$l$ is the distance between the two ends, and .$k$ is a constant called thermal conductivity that depends on the material  Good insulator / poor thermal conductors have a low .$k$  Metals have .$k\u0026gt;1$ Wood, plastics have small .$k$s   Building materials sometimes list the thermal resistance, .$R$, which is equal to .$R = \\frac{l}{k}$ where .$l$ is the material\u0026rsquo;s thickness  Larger .$R$ means better insulation     If .$k$ or .$A$ isn\u0026rsquo;t constant, we consider a small thickness: $$ \\frac{dQ}{dt} = -kA \\frac{dT}{dx}$$ .$\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{l} \\text{ and } \\frac{dT}{dx}$ are called the temperature gradients We have a negative sign in the equation above because the direction of heat flow is opposite to the temperature gradient A steady system state is reached when heat flow through each layer of an object is equal  Convection #   Heat flow by movement of mass Convection involves heat flowing by the bulk movement of molecules from one place to another Whereas conduction involved molecules/electrons moving over small distances, convection involves the movement of a large number of molecules over a long distance Natural Convection occurs in systems where a cold substance (air, water) is warmed and subsequently expands, decreasing density and thus rising Warm fluid/gases are less dense, thus they rise compared to colder fluid/gas  Radiation #   Whereas conduction and convection require a medium, radiation doesn\u0026rsquo;t  The sun\u0026rsquo;s rays are a form of heat and travel through (nearly empty) space  Radiation of the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays arrive on a clear day at a rate around .$1000 \\text{W/m}^2$   Most of the time radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, but infrared (IR) wavelengths are responsible for heating Earth   The rate at which energy leaves a radiation object, .$Q/t$, is $$ \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t} \\varepsilon \\sigma A T^4$$ .$\\varepsilon$ is called emissivity.

Any irreversible engine operating between the same two fixed temperatures will have an efficiency less than this.\n  Only at absolute zero would 100% efficiency be reachable. But getting to absolute zero is a practical (as well as theoretical) impossibility Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics:  no device is possible whose sole effect is to transform a given amount of heat completely into work.\n   20.4 Refrigerators, AC, Heat Pumps #   Refrigerators, air conditioners, and heat pumps are just the reverse of heat engines  Each transfer heat ouf of a cool environments into a warm environment   A perfect fridge (no work required to take heat from low temp to high temp) is impossible  No device is possible whose sole effect is to transfer heat from one region at a temperature .$T_L$ into a second region at a higher temperature .$T_H$ (Clausius statement)\n  Coefficient of Performance (COP): .$\\text{COP} = \\frac{Q_L}{W}$  The more heat .$Q_L$ removed from a fridge for a given amount of work, the more efficient it is Energy is conserved, so we can write .$Q_L + W = Q_H$ or .$W = Q_H-Q_L$ We can then write .$\\text{COP} = \\frac{Q_L}{W} = \\frac{Q_L}{Q_H-Q_L} \\Longrightarrow \\text{COP}_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{T_L}{T_H-T_L}$      Heat pump  Electric motor does work .$W$ to take heat .$Q_L$ from outside at low temperature and delivers heat .$Q_H$ to inside at a hot temperature Whereas fridges cool (remove .$Q_L$), heat pumps heat (deliver .$Q_H$) Thus, COP uses .$Q_H$ instead of .$Q_L$: .$\\text{COP} = \\frac{Q_H}{W}$ COP is greater than 1 because .$W+Q_L = Q_H$     20.5 Entropy #   Entropy, unlike heat, is a state variable and measures the (dis)order of a system When heat is added to a system by a reversible process then change in entropy is $$\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T} \\ \\ \\text{[Constant T]} \\Longrightarrow dS = \\frac{dQ}{T} \\ \\ \\text{[Non-const T]}$$ The change of entropy between two states doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on the process. Thus, $$\\Delta S = S_b - S_a = \\int_a^b dS = \\int_a^b \\frac{dQ}{T}$$  20.6 Entropy and Second Law #   In an isolated system with two objects that eventually reach equilibrium, we can write the change (increase) in entropy as $$\\Delta S = \\Delta S_H + \\Delta S_L = - \\frac{Q}{T_{HM}} + \\frac{Q}{T_{LM}}$$ .$T_{HM}$ is the average temperature between .$T_H$ and .$T_M$ where .$T_M$ is the average between .$T_H$ and .$T_L$  E.x. if .$T_H = 0^\\circ C, T_L = 0^\\circ C$, then .$T_M = 4^\\circ C$ so .$T_{HM} = 6^\\circ C$ and .$T_{LM} = 2^\\circ C$. Also, we use .$Q=mc \\Delta T$ to find heat and use half .$T_{M}$ (in this case .$2^\\circ C$) for .$\\Delta T$ Since .$T_{HM} \u0026gt; T_{LM}, \\Delta S \u0026gt; 0$ is always true While one system may decrease in entropy, the other one always increases more so net always increases   For adiabatic processes, we know .$dQ = dW = P dV$, thus $$\\Delta S_\\text{gas} = \\int \\frac{dQ}{T} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P\\ dV$$ and since we know through the idea gas law that .$P=nRT/V$ so $$\u0026hellip;= \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\frac{nRT}{V}\\ dV = nR \\ \\ln \\bigg(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\bigg)$$  20.7 Order to Disorder #   If we say that entropy is a measure of (dis)order in a system, we can write the second law as  Natural processes tend to move toward a state of greater disorder\n  When ice melts to water at 0¬∞C, the entropy of the water increases.  Intuitively, we can think of solid water, ice, as being more ordered than the less orderly fluid state which can flow all over the place. This change from order to disorder can be seen more clearly from the molecular point of view: the orderly arrangement of water molecules in an ice crystal has changed to the disorderly and somewhat random motion of the molecules in the fluid state.   When a hot substance is put in contact with a cold substance, heat flows from the high temperature to the low until the two substances reach the same intermediate temperature.  At the beginning of the process we can distinguish two classes of molecules: those with a high average kinetic energy (the hot object), and those with a low average kinetic energy (the cooler object). After the process in which heat flows, all the molecules are in one class with the same average kinetic energy; we no longer have the more orderly arrangement of molecules in two classes \u0026ndash; Order has gone to disorder Furthermore, the separate hot and cold objects could serve as the hot and cold-temperature regions of a heat engine, and thus could be used to obtain useful work. But once the two objects are put in contact and reach the same temperature, no work can be obtained. Disorder has increased, because a system that has the ability to perform work must surely be considered to have a higher order than a system no longer able to do work.   When a stone falls to the ground, its macroscopic kinetic energy is transformed to thermal energy.  Thermal energy is associated with the disorderly random motion of molecules, but the molecules in the falling stone all have the same velocity downward in addition to their own random velocities. Thus, the more orderly kinetic energy of the stone as a whole (which could do useful work) is changed to disordered thermal energy when the stone strikes the ground. Disorder increases in this process, as it does in all processes that occur in nature.    20.8 Unavailability of Energy; Heat Death #   In any natural process, some energy becomes unavailable to do useful work\n  That is, as time goes on, both energy is degraded and entropy increases  A rock that falls to the ground could instead used it\u0026rsquo;s energy towards useful work versus exerting kinetic/thermal energy while falling Two separate hot and cold objects could serves as the high and low temperature regions for a heat engine (obtaining useful work). Instead, if the tow objects are put in contact with one another, they\u0026rsquo;ll eventually reach the same uniform temperature and not be able to do any work.   Heat Death: All energy of the universe degrades into thermal energy  Very far out Scientists are unsure whether this is inevitable or whether we can even extrapolate the 2nd law to the scale of our universe    20.9 Statistical Interpretation of Entropy/2nd #   We can only realistically observe macrostates and not microstates  However, we can make inferences about microstates with probabilities Each microstate is equally probable of occurring Thus, the number of microstates that give the same macrostate correspond to the relative probability of that macrostate occurring   The most probable state of a gas is one in which the molecules take up the whole spaces and move about randomly (in a maxwell distribution) At the same time, the very orderly arrangement of all molecules located in one corner of the room and all moving with the same velocity is extremely unlikely Therefore, the probability is directly related to the disorder and hence entropy of the system  The most probably state is the one with greatest entropy or greatest disorder and randomness It\u0026rsquo;s also the macrostate that corresponds to the most microstates   The netropy of a system in a given macro state can be written as: $$ S = k \\ \\ln\\mathscr{W}$$ .$k$ is the Boltzmann\u0026rsquo;s constant and .$\\mathscr{W}$ is the number of microstates corresponding to the given macrostate  That is, .$\\mathscr{W}$ is proportional to the probability of occurrence of that state .$\\mathscr{W}$ is also called the thermodynamic probability or the disorder parameter    20.10 Thermo Temperature; Third Law #   Ideal Carnot Cycles always have the ratio $$\\frac{Q_L}{Q_H} = \\frac{T_L}{T_H}$$ Note that this relation doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on the working substance, thus it can server as the basis for the Kelvin scale The closer a temperature is to abs zero, the more difficult it is to reduce the temp further Third Law:  It is not possible to reach absolute zero in any finite number of processes\n  Thus, since .$e = 1 - \\frac{T_L}{T_H}$ and because .$T_L$ can\u0026rsquo;t ever be zero then 100% efficiency is never possible  "},{"id":10,"href":"/physics-7b/21/","title":"21: Electric Charges \u0026 Fields","section":"Physics 7B","content":"21.1 Static Electricity; Electric Charge and its Conservation #   \u0026ldquo;Charged\u0026rdquo; objects posses a net electric charge Unlike charges attract; like charges repel  Charges on glass are positive, charges on plastic is negative   Law of Conservation of Electric Charge:  Whenever a certain amount of charge is produced in one object, an equal amount of the opposite type of charge is produced in another object  Charges cannot be destroyed or created   E.x. a plastic ruler is rubbed with a paper towel.

When a battery isn\u0026rsquo;t connected, only a small amount of zinc is dissolved  The zinc electrode becomes increasingly negative Thus, any new positive zinc ions produced are attracted back to the electrode   That is, if a charge is allowed to flow then the zinc can dissolve The voltage depends ot the electrodes' material and their relative ability to give up electrons  25.2 Electric Current #   When a circuit is formed, charge can move (flow) through the wires from one terminal to the other  Any flow of charge is called an electric current Flow can only occur on a continuos conducting path (a complete circuit) If there\u0026rsquo;s any break, our circuit is called an open circuit and no current flows   The symbol for battery is the following:     Conventional current from .$+$ to .$-$ is equivalent to a negative electron flow from .$-$ to .$+$     Current in a wire is defined as the net amount of charge that passes through the wire\u0026rsquo;s full cross section at any point in time: $$\\bar I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t} \\Longrightarrow I = \\frac{dQ}{dt}$$ Current is measured in coulombs per second; ampere (amp): .$\\text{1 A = 1 C/s}$  25.3 Ohm\u0026rsquo;s Law: Resistance and Resistors #   For a current to exist, there must be a potential difference (e.g. between the terminals of a battery) That is, the current is proportional to the potential difference: $$I \\propto V$$  E.x., a wire connected to a .$6V$ battery results in a current twice that of a .$3V$ battery   The current depends on the resistance that the wires offers  The electron flow is impeded partly due to the atoms in the wire .$R$ is this proportionality factor between voltage and current Thus, we get Ohm\u0026rsquo;s Law: $$V=IR$$   Ohm\u0026rsquo;s law only works for when .$R$ is a constant, i.e a metal conductor  In reality, .$R$ isn\u0026rsquo;t constant if temperature changes much Materials that follow Ohm\u0026rsquo;s law are labeled as \u0026ldquo;ohmic\u0026rdquo; Resistance has the units/notation .$\\text{1 $\\Omega$ = 1 V/A}$   Resistors are used to limit/control the current in a circuit  toolbox.mehvix.com/resistor As a current passes through a resistor, the charge/current stays the same but the electric potential decreases  Clarifications of Behavior\n Current\u0026rsquo;s magnitude depends on that device\u0026rsquo;s resistance  Can be though of as the \u0026ldquo;response\u0026rdquo; to the voltage: increases if voltage increases or resistance decreases Current is constant \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s energy so it cannot be destroyed by components and it\u0026rsquo;s not created by a battery   Resistance is a property of the device/wire Voltage is external to the wire of device \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s applied across the two ends of the wire  Batteries maintain a constant potential difference \u0026ndash; act as a source of voltage     25.4 Resistivity #   Resistivity has experimentally been found as $$R = \\rho \\frac{l}{A}$$  .$\\rho$ is the resistivity (constant of proportionality) and depends on the material  Has units .$\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m = V/A $\\cdot $ m}$   .$l$ is the wire length .$A$ is the cross-section area   The reciprocal of resistivity is conductivity: .$\\sigma = \\rho^{-1}$  Temperature #   Resistivity varies (generally increasing) with temperature $$\\rho_T = \\rho_0 = \\bigg[ 1+ \\alpha (T-T_0)\\bigg]$$  .$\\rho_0$ is the resistivity at some reference temperature .$T_0$ (i.e .$0^\\circ \\text{ C}$) .$\\rho_T$ is the new resistivity at the current (higher) temperature .$T$ .$\\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistivity that depends on material   Note that the temperature coefficient for semiconductors can be negative.  At higher temperatures, some of the electrons that are normally not free in a semiconductor can become free and contribute to the current. Thus, the resistance of a semiconductor can decrease with an increase in temperature.    25.5 Electric Power #   Electric energy is transformed into thermal energy (and light) in stove burners, toasters, etc.  The current creates collisions between the moving electrons and the atoms in the wire That is, the KE from the wire\u0026rsquo;s atoms increases meaning the temperature increases too $$P = \\frac{dU}{dt} = \\frac{dq}{dt}\\cdot V$$   This is because energy is transformed when a tiny charge .$dq$ moves through a potential difference .$V$ is .$dU = V\\ dq$ The charge that flows per second, .$dq/dt$, is the electric current .$I$: $$P= IV = I^2 R = \\frac{V^2}{R}$$  The SI unit for power is the watt: .$\\text{1 W = 1 J/s}$ We get the last two equations by plugging in .$V=IR$    25.7 Alternating Current #   When a battery is connected to a circuit, the current moves steadily in one direction (DC: Direct Current) Electric generators at power plants produce AC: alternating current  Reverses direction many times per second and is commonly sinusoidal $$V = V_0 \\sin(2\\pi ft) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$$ .$\\omega$ = .$2\\pi f$ .$f$ is the frequency: number of complete oscillations per second  Commonly .$\\text{60 Hz}$ in NA   Potential .$V$ oscillates between .$\\pm V_0$, the peak voltage   Current equation still works: $$I = \\frac{V}{R} = \\frac{V_0}{R}\\sin\\omega t = I_0 \\sin\\omega t$$  .$I_0 = V_0/R$ is the peak current Avg current is 0; it\u0026rsquo;s positive and negative for an equal amount of time  Doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that no heat is created or no power is needed Electrons are still moving though!     Power is also consistent $$P=I^2R = I_0^2 R \\sin\\omega t = \\frac{V_0^2}{R} \\sin\\omega t$$  Power is always positive because current is squared Since the .$\\sin\\dots$ oscillates between 1 and 0, the average power is $$\\overline P = \\frac{1}{2}I_0^2R = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{V_0^2}{R}$$ This can also be calculated by using the RMS values for .$I$ and .$V$ $$I_\\text{rms} = \\sqrt{\\overline I^2} = \\frac{I_0}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707 I_0$$ $$V_\\text{rms} = \\sqrt{\\overline V^2} = \\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707 V_0$$ $$\\dots \\Longrightarrow \\overline P = I_\\text{rms} V_\\text{rms} = I_\\text{rms}^2 R = \\frac{V_\\text{rms}^2}{R}$$ Fun fact: we can use the rms of a value to find the peak of it, e.x. $$V_0 = \\sqrt{2} V_\\text{rms}$$ Keep in mind that this is the average power. Instantaneous power varies from .$0$ to .$2\\overline P$    25.8 Microscopic View of Current #   We\u0026rsquo;ve seen that electric current can be carried by negatively charged electrons in metal wires, and that in liquid solutions current can also be carried by positive and/or negatively charged ions When a potential difference is applied to the two ends of a wire, the direction of the electric field .$\\vec E$ is parallel to the walls of the wire  This field within the conducting wire does not contradict our earlier result that .$\\vec E = 0$ inside a conductor in the electrostatic case, as we are no longer dealing with the static case. That is, charges are free to move in a conductor, and hence can move under the action of the electric field.  If all the charges are at rest, then .$\\vec E = 0$       Current Density #   Current density, .$\\vec j$, is the current per area $$j = \\frac{I}{A} \\Longrightarrow I = \\int \\vec j \\cdot d \\vec A$$  .$I$ is the current through the whole surface .$d\\vec A$ is an element of surface area over which the integration is taken Direction of the density is the same direction as .$\\vec E$ \u0026ndash; the direction that a positive charge would move    Drift Speed #   Inside a wire, we can imagine the free electrons as moving about randomly at high speeds, bouncing off the metal atoms of the wire  Somewhat like the molecules of a gas   When an electric field exists in the wire the electrons feel a force and initially begin to accelerate but they soon reach a more or less steady average speed, known as their drift speed .$v_d$  Collisions with atoms in the wire keep them from accelerating further The drift speed is normally very much smaller than the electrons‚Äô average random speed inside the metal wire     Black zagged line represents the motion of an electron in a metal wire due to an electric field. The field .$\\vec E$ gives electrons in random motion a net drift velocity .$\\vec v_d$. Its direction (the net charge flow) is in the opposite direction of .$\\vec E$ because electrons have a negative charge and .$\\vec F = q \\vec E$   We can relate drift speed with the macroscopic view:  In some time, the electrons travel (the average) distance .$l = v_d \\Delta t$ In that same time, electrons in volume .$V = Al = A v_d \\Delta t$ pass through area .$A$ of the wire If there are .$n$ free electrons each of charge .$-e$ per unit volume, then the total electrons is .$N = nV$ Thus, the charge is $$\\Delta Q = \\text{(number of charges, $N$)$\\times$(charge per particle, $-e$)}$$ $$\\dots = (nV)(-e) = -(nAv_d\\Delta T)(e)$$ We can then easily find the current (density): $$I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t} = -neAv_d$$ $$j = \\frac{I}{A} = -nev_d$$ Notice that the negative sign indicates that the direction of (positive) current flow is opposite to the drift speed of electrons.    Field inside a Wire #   Voltage can be written in terms of microscopic values (in addition to the macro: .$V = IR$) Resistance is related to density by $$R = \\rho \\frac{l}{A}$$ We can then write .$V$, .$I$ and .$j$ as $$V = El = IR = (jA)(\\rho \\frac{l}{A}) = j \\rho l$$  $$I = jA$$  $$j = \\frac{1}{\\rho}E = \\sigma E$$    .$\\sigma$ is the conductivity of the wire .$\\rho, \\sigma$ do not vary with .$V$ and thus neither .$E$   We can then write the microscopic statement of Ohm\u0026rsquo;s Law: $$\\vec j = \\sigma \\vec E = \\frac{\\vec E}{\\rho}$$  25.9 Superconductivity #   At very low temperatures, the resistivity of certain metals and certain compounds or alloys becomes zero Materials in such a state are said to be superconducting In general, superconductors become superconducting only below a certain transition (critical) temperature, .$T_C$   "},{"id":15,"href":"/physics-7b/26/","title":"26: DC Circuits","section":"Physics 7B","content":"26.1 EMF and Terminal Voltage #   EMF  To have a current, we need an emf (electromotive force) device to transform one type of energy (chemical, mechanical, light) into electric energy  The term ‚Äúelectromotive force‚Äù is a misnomer: it does not refer to a ‚Äúforce,‚Äù which is measured in newtons. To avoid confusion, we use the abbreviation, emf.   EMF of the Source: The potential difference between the terminals of a source when no current flows to an external circuit .$\\mathscr{E}$ is used for emf and it\u0026rsquo;s units is (V)olts   Batteries  Batteries don\u0026rsquo;t have constant current (it varies with resistance of the circuit) Voltage is nearly constant, but decreases when battery cannot supply charge fast enough to maintain full emf  This occurs because the charge must move between/through the electrodes in the battery Additionally, the battery has some internal resistance, .$r$   Batteries are treated as a perfect emf .$\\mathscr{E}$ in a series with a resistor .$r$  The terminal voltage is .$V_\\text{ab} = V_a - V_b$  When a battery is being charged, a current is forced to pass through it; we then have to write .$V_\\text{ab} = \\mathscr{E} + Ir$   When no current is drawn, .$V_\\text{ab} = \\mathscr{E} - Ir$  .$Ir$ comes from the fact that when .$I$ flows from the battery it causes an internal voltage drop .$Ir$   Since .$\\mathscr{E} - Ir = IR \\Longrightarrow \\mathscr{E} = I(R+r)$ for .$R$ as the resistance of the circuit      26.2 Resistors in Series and Parallel #  Series #   Any charge that passes through one resistor passes through all  Hence, the same current .$I$ passes through each too (constant) If this wasn\u0026rsquo;t true, then it would imply either the charge was not conserved   Voltage from the battery is split between each resistor proportional to .$R$ $$V = V_1 + V_2 + \\dots = I R_1 + I R_2 + \\dots = I(R_1 + R_2 + \\dots)$$  Thus, .$R_\\text{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + \\dots$   Note that when you add more resistance to the circuit\u0026hellip;  The current that passes through each resistor decreases The equivalent resistance increases Voltage stays the same since the battery is unaltered    Parallel #   Current is split from the source path into branches  Thus, paths outside of one\u0026rsquo;s branch doesn\u0026rsquo;t impact/interrupt current The current from each branch must equal the total current; i.e $$I = I_1 + I_2 + \\dots$$   Voltage across each resistor is equivalent; $$I_1 = \\frac{V}{R_1}, I_2 = \\frac{V}{R_2}, \\dots$$ $$ \\Longrightarrow I = \\frac{V}{R_\\text{eq}}$$  Thus, .$R_\\text{eq}$ is equal to $$ \\frac{1}{R_\\text{eq}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\dots$$   Note that when you add another resistor to the circuit\u0026hellip;  Net resistance goes down  Adding another resistor adds another path causing current to decrease   Voltage stays the same since the battery is unaltered Consistent with .$R = \\rho l/A$ definition of resistance  Series is effectively increasing the length Parallel increases the area through which current flows      26.3 Kirchhoff\u0026rsquo;s Rules #   We use Kirchhoff\u0026rsquo;s two rules when circuits get too complex for trivial analysis  1. Junction Rule: At any junction point, the sum of all currents entering the junction must equal the sum of all currents leaving the junction.   That is, what goes out must come back in Based on conservation of electric charge  2. Loop Rule: The sum of the changes in potential around any closed loop of a circuit must be zero.   That is, what goes up must come back down  There is as much up as there is down At the battery, the gain/loss on each terminal cancel one another along the closed circuit path   Based on conservation of energy  26.4 EMFs in Series and Parallel; Charging a Battery #   (a) Two similarly arranged batteries in a series sum their voltages; e.x. 3V (b) Two oppositely arranged batteries in a series subtract their voltages; e.x. 8V  How battery charging works The 20V source is charging up the 12V battery Because of it\u0026rsquo;s greater voltage, the 20V is forcing charge back into the 12V   (c) Two batteries in parallel, which if the emfs are the same, can provide more energy when large currents are needed.  Each of the cells in parallel has to produce only a fraction of the total current, so the energy loss due to internal resistance is less than for a single cell Thus, the batteries will drain less quickly.        26.5 RC Circuits: Resistor \u0026amp; Capacitor in Series #   RC Circuits differ in that they have varying current  Capacitor Charging #   After the switch .$S$ closes in the RC circuit shown in (a), the voltage across the capacitor increases with time as shown in (b), and the current through the resistor decreases with time as shown in (c).\n    (a) When closed, the current starts flowing through the circuit from the negative terminal through .$R$ and accumulate on the upper plate of the capacitor which creates potential difference equal to .$V_C = Q/C$  Current is then reduced because of this opposing voltage on the capacitor   (b) Eventually, the potential equals the emf, .$\\mathscr{E}$, and then no current flows and no potential difference across the resistor  Potential difference, .$V_C$, across the capacitor is equal to the charge on it, .$V_C = Q/C$ Because charge increases with time, so does voltage until this point The emf .$\\mathscr{E}$ of the battery will equal the sum of the voltage drops across the resistor and the capacitor: $$\\mathscr{E} = IR + \\frac{Q}{C}$$  .$R$ is total circuit resistance, including battery .$I$ is current at all points in the circuit at any instant .$Q$ is the charge of the capacitor at that same instant Notice: .$\\mathscr{E}, R, C$ are constants, .$Q, I$ are functions of time     (c) As charge builds up on the capacitor, the current decreases exponentially in time with a time constant .$\\tau$ equal to .$RC$     The rate at which charge flows thorough the resistor (.$I = dQ/dT$) is equal to the rate at which charge accumulates on the capacitor: $$ \\mathscr{E} = \\bigg(\\frac{dQ}{dt}\\bigg)R + \\frac{1}{C}Q$$ This can then be used to find an equation of .$Q$: $$ \\Longrightarrow \\frac{dQ}{C\\mathscr{E} - Q} = \\frac{dt}{RC} \\Longrightarrow \\int_0^Q \\frac{dQ}{C\\mathscr{E} - Q} = \\frac{1}{RC}\\int_0^t dt$$ $$ \\Longrightarrow \\ln\\bigg(1 - \\frac{Q}{C \\mathscr{E}}\\bigg) = - \\frac{t}{RC} \\Longrightarrow 1 - \\frac{Q}{C\\mathscr{E}} = e^{-t/RC}$$ $$ \\Longrightarrow Q = C\\mathscr{E}(1-e^{-t/RT}) = Q_0 (1-e^{-t/RT})$$  .$Q_0 = C \\mathscr{E}$ represents the maximum charge on the capacitor  .$Q_0 \\neq \\text{charge $(Q)$ at $t=0$}$ The potential difference across the capacitor is .$V_C = Q/C$ so the maximum value is $$ \\Longrightarrow V_C = \\mathscr{E}(1-e^{-t/RC})$$     .$\\tau = RC$ is the axis units on graph (b) and is aptly called the time constant of the circuit  Represents the time required for the capacitor to reach .$(1-e^{-1}) = 0.63 = 63\\text{%}$ of its full charge and voltage  Also represents the time for the current to drop to .$1/e \\approx 0.37$ of it\u0026rsquo;s initial value   Thus, it measures how quickly the capacitor becomes charged We use this as a measurement since the maximums only occur as we take .$t \\to \\infty$, but these values reach 86% of the way in .$2RC = 2\\tau$, 95% in .$3\\tau$, 98% in .$4\\tau$, so on   The current in the circuit at any time can be found by differentiating the following: $$I = \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{\\mathscr{E}}{R}e^{-t/RC}$$  This is an exponential decay function: when .$t=0$, the current is largest because there is no charge on the capacitor to impede it That is, .$I=I_0= \\mathscr{E}/R$ As charge builds up, the current decreases exponentially in time (as shown in (c))    Capacitor Discharging #   Now imagine the opposite case; we start fully charged at .$Q_0$ with voltage .$V_0$ and have to discharge through resistance .$R$ The voltage across the resistor at any instant equals that across the capacitor: $$V = IR = \\frac{Q}{C}$$ We can use this to find the functions for both .$Q_0$ and .$V_C$: $$ - \\frac{dQ}{dt} R = \\frac{Q}{C} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{dq}{Q} = - \\frac{dt}{RC}$$ $$ \\ln \\frac{Q}{Q_0} = - (t/RC) \\Longrightarrow Q = Q_0 e^{-t/RC}$$ $$ \\dots \\Longrightarrow V_C = V_0 e^{-t/RC}$$  For the RC circuit shown in (a), the voltage .$V_C$ across the capacitor decreases with time, as shown in (b), after the switch S is closed at .$t=0$. The charge on the capacitor follows the same curve because .$Q \\propto V_C$   $$$$ $$$$\n .$V_0 = Q_0 / C$ is the initial voltage, related to initial charge We can see the charge on the capacitor, thus the voltage across it, decreases exponentially in time Current is found to be $$I = - \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{Q_0}{RC}e^{-t/RC} = I_0 e^{-t/RC}$$ The charge on the capacitor, the voltage across it, and the current in the resistor all decrease to 37% of their original value in one time constant .$t = \\tau \\ RC$      26.6 Electric Hazards and Safety #   Current above .$\\text{1 mA}$ can be felt Current above .$\\text{10 mA}$ cause severe contraction of muscles (may not be able to let go of source) Current above .$\\text{80-100 mA}$ that passes through the torso (passing through the heart for a second) will cause ventricular fibrillation (heart stops pumping blood properly) It\u0026rsquo;s current that harms, even though voltage drives the current  The seriousness of a shock depends on the current and thus the applied voltage and the effective resistance of the body More voltage shocks, more current kills Wet skin has resistance of .$10^3 \\Omega$ while dry skin is around .$10^5 \\Omega$    26.7 Ammeters and Voltmeters: Measurement Affects Quantity Measured #   Measuring is hard to do both precisely and consistently Ammeters measure current (amps) and voltmeters measure potential difference or voltage (volts) An analog ammeter or voltmeter uses a galvanometer  The full scale sensitivity, .$I_m$, is the electric current required to make the needle deflect a full scale; typically .$50 \\mu\\text{A}$     An ammeter is a galvanometer in parallel with a shunt resistor with low resistance, .$R_\\text{sh}$    A voltmeter is a galvanometer in series with a resistor with high resistance, .$R_\\text{ser}$     (b) Because an ammeter is used to measure the current flowing in the circuit, it must be inserted directly into the circuit, in series with the other elements. The smaller its internal resistance, the less it affects the circuit. (c) A voltmeter is connected ‚Äúexternally,‚Äù in parallel with the circuit element across which the voltage is to be measured. It measures the potential difference between two points. Its two wire ‚Äúleads‚Äù (connecting wires) are connected to the two points.  Only .$R_1$ is being measured above        If the resistance of a voltmeter is much higher than the resistance of the circuit, it will have little effect and its readings can be more accurate  At least to the manufactured precision of the meter, which for analog meters is typically 3% to 4% of full-scale deflection.   Sensitivity: The sensitivity of a voltmeter is specified on its face as, for example, .$10,000\\ \\Omega/\\text{V}$. Then on the .$5\\text{V}$ scale, the voltmeter would have a resistance given by .$\\text{(5V)(10,000 $\\Omega$/V) = 50,000 $\\Omega$}$ Even an ammeter can interfere with a circuit, but the effect is minimal if its resistance is much less than that of the circuit as a whole. For both voltmeters and ammeters, the more sensitive the galvanometer, the less effect it will have on the circuit.

The right hand rule, in its different forms, is intended to help you determine the direction of magnetic field, and the force a field exerts, and/or the directions of electric current or charged particle velocity.

To change an objects speed, you must apply a force along the objects direction of motion The magnetic field exerts a force on particles moving orthogonal to it Therefore, no work can be done because the particle can only move orthogonal to the magnetic field That being said, realize that this field is responsible for the circular, constant speed, motion This is why earth\u0026rsquo;s magnetic field deflects, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t slow down, charged particles from outer space    27.5 Torque on a Current Loop; Magnetic Dipole Moment #   Calculating the torque on a current loop in a magnetic field .$\\vec B$\n   (a) Loop face parallel to .$\\vec B$ field lines; (b) top view; (c) loop makes an angle to .$\\vec B$, reducing the torque since the lever arm is reduced. The vector .$\\vec \\mu$ is the ‚Äúmagnetic moment‚Äù.\n   When an electric current flows in a closed wire loop that\u0026rsquo;s in an external magnetic field, the magnetic force on the current can produce a torque $$\\tau = I aB \\frac{b}{2} + I aB \\frac{b}{2}$$ $$\\dots = IabB$$  .$A = ab$ is the area of the loop .$B$ is scalar of the magnetic field Notice, the vertical (orthogonal) sections of wire experience no force from the magnetic field   If we have a coil of .$N$ loops of wire, the current is then .$NI$ so torque becomes $$\\tau = NIAB$$  We call .$\\vec \\mu = NI \\vec A$ the magnetic dipole moment The direction of .$\\vec A$ (and thus .$\\vec \\mu$) is defined as perpendicular to the plane of the coil   We can then re-write our torque eq as $$\\vec \\tau = NI \\vec A \\times \\vec B$$ $$\\dots \\vec \\tau = \\vec \\mu \\times \\vec B$$ Dipoles have some potential energy, found by $$U = \\int \\tau d\\theta = \\int NIAB\\sin\\theta d \\theta$$ $$\\dots = -\\mu B \\cos\\theta = - \\vec \\mu \\cdot \\vec B$$    27.8 Hall Effect #   When a current-carrying conductor is held fixed in a magnetic field, the field exerts a sideways force on the charge moving in the conductor  E.x, if electrons move to the right in the rectangular conductor, the inward magnetic field will exert a downward force: (a) This force is .$F_B = -e\\vec v_d \\times \\vec B$  .$v_d$ is drift velocity     Thus, electrons tend to move towards side .$D$  This creates a potential difference (called the Hall emf), creating field .$\\vec E_H$ This field exerts force .$e\\vec E_H$ on the moving charge   These forces are equal, that is, $$e E_H = ev_d B$$ $$\\therefore E_H = v_d B$$ Hall emf is then, asm uniform .$E_H$, $$\\mathscr{E}_H = E_H d = v_d B d$$  .$d$ is the width of the conductor         The Hall effect. (a) Negative charges moving to the right as the current. (b) Positive charges moving to the left as the current.\n   27.9 Mass Spectrometer #     Mass spectrometers are used to measure the masses of atoms\n  Steps:    Ions are produced (by a current or heating) and they pass through slit .$S_1$ Ions then pass through a region with perpendicular electric and magnetic fields.  Here, .$F_E = qE$ is equal to .$F_B = qvB$ Therefore, .$v = \\frac{E}{B}$ for all ions that pass the slit into .$S_2$; the rest are deflected        Entering .$S_2$, there is only magnetic field .$B'$ so the ios follow a circular path  Newtons second gives us .$F=ma \\Longrightarrow qvB' = mv^2/r$ Since we know all terms, we can solve for mass: .$m = \\frac{qB\u0026rsquo;r}{v} = \\frac{qBB\u0026rsquo;r}{E}$    "},{"id":17,"href":"/physics-7b/28/","title":"28: Sources of Magnetic Field","section":"Physics 7B","content":"28.1 Magnetic Field Due to a Straight Wire #   Magnetic fields due to the electric current in a long straight wire forms circles with the wire at the center This field is proportional directly with current .$I$ and inversely with distance .$r$: $$B = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{I}{r}$$  .$\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ T$\\cdot$m/A}$ is the permeability of free space       28.2 Force between Two Parallel Wires #    Since current-carrying wires feel a force in magnetic fields, and because current-carrying wires emit magnetic fields, current-carrying wires exert a force on one another Magnetic field .$B_1$ produced by .$I_1$ is given by $$B_1 = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{I_1}{d}$$ Parallel currents in the same direction attract while antiparallel repel     Using .$F = IlB$ we can write the force .$F_2$ exerted by .$B_1$ on length .$l_2$ carrying .$I_2$ has magnitude: $$F_2 = I_2 l_2 B_1$$  Notice that the force on .$I_1$ is due to the field produced by .$I_1$ Thus, subbing .$B_1$ into the .$F_2$ formula we find the force on length .$l_2$: $$F_2 = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{I_1 I_2}{d}l_2$$    28.3 Definitions of the Ampere and the Coulomb #  One ampere can be defined as that current flowing in each of two long parallel wires exactly 1 m apart, which results in a force of exactly .$2\\times10^{-7}$ N per meter of length of each wire   This was the standard we used prior because it is readily reproducible (that is, it\u0026rsquo;s called an operational definition) Coulomb is defined in terms of the ampere being exactly one ampere-second: .$\\text{1 C = A $\\cdot$ s}$  Now we define an ampere ampere by saying it\u0026rsquo;s .$\\text{1 C = A $\\cdot$ s}$ and we know the Coulomb because it\u0026rsquo;s mutually assigned the exact value .$e = 1.60176636 \\times 10^{-19}\\text{ C}$    28.4 Amp√®re‚Äôs Law #   If we don\u0026rsquo;t have a straight line, we use ampere\u0026rsquo;s law given below We take a infinite tiny segments and dot it with the field at the segment: $$\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d \\vec l = \\mu_0 I_\\text{encl}$$ Note that .$\\vec B$ in Ampere\u0026rsquo;s law isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily due only to the current .$I_\\text{encl}$ As with Gauss‚Äôs law for the electric field, Ampere\u0026rsquo;s law practical value to calculate the magnetic field is limited, however, mainly to simple or symmetric situations.  Its importance is that it relates the magnetic field to the current in a direct and mathematically elegant way.        Amp√®re‚Äôs law is considered one of the basic laws of electricity and magnetism: It is valid for any situation where the currents and fields are steady and not changing in time, and no magnetic materials are present  Problem Solving: #   Amp√®re‚Äôs law, like Gauss‚Äôs law, is always a valid statement. But as a calculation tool it is limited mainly to systems with a high degree of symmetry. The first step in applying Amp√®re‚Äôs law is to identify useful symmetry. Choose an integration path that reflects the symmetry. Search for paths where .$B$ has constant magnitude along the entire path or along segments of the path. Make sure your integration path passes through the point where you wish to evaluate the magnetic field. Use symmetry to determine the direction of .$\\vec B$ along the integration path. With a smart choice of path, .$\\vec B$ will be either parallel or perpendicular to the path. Determine the enclosed current, .$I_\\text{encl}$. Be careful with signs. Let the fingers of your right hand curl along the direction of .$\\vec B$ so that your thumb shows the direction of positive current. If you have a solid conductor and your integration path does not enclose the full current, you can use the current density (current per unit area) multiplied by the enclosed area.   28.5 Magnetic Field of a Solenoid and a Toroid #   Solenoid: A long looping coil of wire carrying a dc current  The current in each loop produces a magnetic field The total magnetic field is the sum of the fields due to each loop Direction is determined by the right hand rule $$\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d \\vec l = \\mu_0 NI$$     Magnetic field due to a solenoid (a) a few loosely spaced loops; (b) for many closely spaced loops, the field is nearly uniform.\n   Cross-sectional view into a solenoid. The magnetic field inside is straight except at the ends. Red dashed lines indicate the path chosen for use in Amp√®re‚Äôs law. .$\\odot$ and .$\\otimes$ are electric current direction (in the wire loops) out of the page and into the page.\n $$\\int_c^d \\vec B \\cdot d \\vec l = Bl_{cd}$$\n   With .$n = N/l$ is number of loops per unit length we can simplify to $$B = \\mu_0 nI$$ Now, we see that the field does not depend on position within the solenoid, so .$\\vec B$ is uniform.  This is strictly true only for an infinite solenoid, but it is a good approximation for tightly wound real ones for points not close to the ends.    28.6 Biot-Savart Law #   A current .$I$ flowing in any path can be considered as many tiny current elements, such as .$d \\vec l$  Then, .$d\\vec B$ at any point .$P$ in space due to this element of current is given by Biot-Savart law: $$d\\vec B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi} \\frac{d\\vec l \\times \\hat r}{r^2} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi} \\frac{dl \\sin\\theta}{r^2}$$ .$\\vec r$ is the displacement vector from the element .$d \\vec l$ to the point .$P$ .$\\hat r$ is the unit vector in the direction .$\\vec r$ .$\\theta$ is the angle between .$d\\vec l$ and .$\\vec r$      Biot-Savart Law The field at P due to current element .$I d\\vec l$ is .$d \\vec B = (\\mu_0 I/4\\pi)(d\\vec l \\times \\hat r/r^3)$\n    Integrating to find the total magnetic field at point .$P$ is then found by the following: $$\\vec B = \\int d\\vec B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{d \\vec l \\times \\hat r}{r^2}$$ An important difference between the Biot-Savart law and Amp√®re‚Äôs law is that the later, .$\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l = \\mu_0 I_\\text{encl}$, .$\\vec B$ is not necessarily due only to the current enclosed by the path of integration. But in the Biot-Savart law the field .$d\\vec B$ is due only, and entirely, to the current element .$I d\\vec l$ \u0026ndash; that is, to find the total .$\\vec B$ at any point in space, it is necessary to include all currents.

If .$v$ is slow enough to be measured, .$B$ is small enough it\u0026rsquo;s going to be drowned out by experimental noise   From the particles frame, it\u0026rsquo;s at rest (not moving wrt itself). And since it\u0026rsquo;s at rest, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t create a field. However, it\u0026rsquo;s moving because it\u0026rsquo;s creating a field!  Einstein explains this with special relativity Observers in two different reference frames, moving relative to each other, will not observe the same .$\\vec E$ and .$\\vec B$ fields        What see from the perspective other than the particle: The magnetic field at one single instant due to a single positive charge .$q$ moving at velocity .$\\vec v$.\n 28.8 Magnetic Materials‚ÄîFerromagnetism #   Magnetic fields are produced by (1) magnets and (2) electric currents Ferromagnetism: Materials that are magnetic  At a small enough resolution (less than 1mm areas!), domains exist which behave like tiny magnets \u0026ndash; they have two poles The more domains that are aligned in one direction, the stronger the magnetic field   These domains can be moved around (through dropping or hammering the magnet) Heating also reduces magnetism \u0026ndash; increasing temp increases the random thermal motion of atoms  Above the Curie Temperature (1043K for iron), a magnet cannot be made at all As a consequence, at lower temperatures, some materials are magnetic       (a) An unmagnetized piece of iron is made up of domains that are randomly arranged. Each domain is like a tiny magnet; the arrows represent the magnetization direction, with the arrowhead being the N pole. (b) In a magnet, the domains are preferentially aligned in one direction (down in this case), and may be altered in size by the magnetization process.\n    Today, we believe that all magnetic fields come from electric currents  Electrons produce a (tiny) magnetic field, as if they and their electric charges were spinning about their own additional axes   Realize that while .$\\vec B$ lines form closed loops, .$\\vec E$ lines go from a positive to negative electron  28.9 Electromagnets and Solenoids‚ÄîApplications #    Solenoids act like magnets; they have poles (determined by the right hand rule)\n  Magnetic field of a solenoid. The north pole of this solenoid, thought of as a magnet, is on the right, and the south pole is on the left.\n   If a piece of iron is placed inside a solenoid, the magnetic field is increased greatly\n The domains of the iron are aligned by the magnetic field produced by the current; that is, the iron becomes a magnet. This system of the iron-core solenoid is called an electromagnet The resulting magnetic field is the sum of the field due to the solenoid‚Äôs current and the field due to the iron, and can be hundreds or thousands of times larger than the field due to the current alone     The alloys of iron used in electromagnets acquire and lose their magnetism quite readily when the current is turned on or off, and so are referred to as ‚Äúsoft iron.‚Äù (It is ‚Äúsoft‚Äù only in a magnetic sense.) Soft iron is usually used in electromagnets so that the field can be turned on and off readily.    Iron that holds its magnetism even when there is no externally applied field is called ‚Äúhard iron.‚Äù Hard iron is used in permanent magnets. Whether iron is hard or soft depends on heat treatment, type of alloy, and other factors.     Sometimes an iron core is not present‚Äîthe magnetic field then comes only from the current in the wire loops.  A large field .$B$ in this case requires a large current .$I$ which produces a large amount of waste heat since .$P=I^2 R$.   But if the current-carrying wires are made of superconducting material kept below the transition temperature then very high magnetic fields can be produced, and no electric power is needed to maintain the large current in the superconducting coils.  Note that energy is required to refrigerate the coils at the low temperatures where they superconduct.    28.10 Magnetic Fields in Magnetic Materials; Hysteresis #   The solenoid field is produced just .$n$ loops per unit length is .$B_0 = \\mu_0 n I$ If a solenoid contains a ferromagnetic material (e.x. iron), then we need to consider it\u0026rsquo;s field .$B_M$ produced in our total field calculation: $$\\vec B = \\vec B_0 + \\vec B_M$$  Often, .$B_M \\gg B_0$   We can also write this equation as $$B = \\mu n I$$  .$\\mu$ is the magnetic permeability (not electric dipole moment!)

Agriculture Anthropogenic Fire \u0026ndash; Agricultural Fire Regime #   Required fire to alter the natural vegetation from perennial-dominated to annual-dominated landscapes. People preferred to live in fire-prone places because the burning provides advantages for hunting, foraging, cultivating, and livestock herding  4. Industrial and Domestic Anthropogenic Fire \u0026ndash; Industrial Fire Regime #   Low-severity surface fire regimes are being replaced with low-frequency, high-intensity crown fires that are outside the historical range of variability for these ecosystems Western US: forests have also experienced an increase in hazardous fuels due to highly effective fire suppression policy that excluded fires for much of the 20th century Eastern US: Fire suppression has shifted oak and pine woodlands to mesophytic hardwoods consequently reducing flammability and fire activity Globally: urban areas have steadily expanded into wildland areas  Producing more ignition sources (arson and accidental) Exposing more people to wildfire    Key Factors in Fire Regimes (Discussion 8-30) #   Frequency  The interval of fire occurrences E.x. every four years   Area  Size, distribution, location Ground fires (primarily dead plants) vs crown (burning upper canopy of living trees)  Crown fires areas are more difficult to manage because controlled burns still damage natural resources     Severity  How destructive a fire is (high mortality = high severity) Change in dominant species / change in ecosystem Quantifiable by how much soil on the ground is visible   Seasonality  How the season affects fires May or may not be annual May arise due to weather conditions Ex. Annual to decadal cycles of drying conditions   Interactions  General activity on the landscape leading to different fire outcomes Droughts leading to stress on fuels Beatles eating bark, making trees more vulnerable Fire suppression leading to less severe fires Climate change making fires more severe    Biodiversity and Fire as a Selective Variable in Evolution #   C4 grass  Spread during seasonal climate in the tertiary period (when fires became more common) Fires lead to woodlands and created environments favorable to C4 grasslands Since C4 is high flammability, it would have produced a feedback process that further increased fire activity,  Thus maintaining the grassland-dominated landscape This process is similar to the one currently maintaining many of our savannas     Plant attributes  Heat shock  Certain species have seeds that will open with heat Not exclusive to fire; correlated with soil heat too   Smoke  Highly selective and specific to fire Smoke is a mixture of specific chemicals unique to itself   Note that plants become resistant to certain fire regimes, not necessarily all  Changes in fire regime can kill off fire resistant plants     Even small differences in the deployment of fire outside of natural lightning strikes can alter patterns of forest succession, fuel availability, and seasonality of ignitions  Fires Relating to Evolution #   Beneficial Attributes  Cooking hypothesis  Key claim: Fire + cooking started with the Homo erectus. As such, humans have evolved around a cooked diet that they can\u0026rsquo;t live without Led to fitness advantage More energy + nutrient from food, enabling body and brain size increase Detoxing effect Increase digestibility of all food Cooking takes time, leading to social development  Distribution of tasks among group: (collection, preparation, even stealing)   Cooking accounts for reduction in jaw, tooth size (due to softer food), stomach, and digestive system size There is no evidence of modern human societies existing without cooked food Counterpoints:  It\u0026rsquo;s still unclear that Homo erectus controlled fire There are some sites that show no example of cooking: e.g. Neanderthal sites in cold climates Energetic effects aren\u0026rsquo;t well quantified Digestive evolution may not have been linear; other adaptations related to fire occurred after Homo erectus     Protection benefits at night (especially versus the alternative: sleeping in trees) Allowed much better vision in caves  Enables cave art   Evidence that some hominids could use fire to morph certain woods into tools (e.g. digging sticks, hafted spears) Allowed humans to colonize colder environments Increase prey abundances, maintain mosaic landscapes, and increase pyrodiversity and succession stage heterogeneity   Social bonding  Led to camp fires Allows people to stay up later Fire could be used as a story telling enhancer, means to pass on history, culture, etc. Provides a sense of intimacy and openness Opportunity for music    Fire-stick farming  clearing ground for human habitats facilitating travel killing vermin, hunting regenerating plant food sources for both humans and livestock warfare among tribes   Woody, closed-canopy shrublands were opened up or entirely displaced  Led to spread of fast-growing annual species that provided greater seed resources, travel, and hunting and planting opportunities Ex. CA land was only used for agriculture after burnings, which led to many other alien plants spreading too Reductions in arboreal cover and woody understory have the most potential to enhance erosion Reshaping of landscapes has posed problems for ecologists trying to understand contemporary landscape patterns    Overview of Fires in California #   Conflagrating California\n ~54% of CA ecosystems depend on fire The remaining ecosystems that aren\u0026rsquo;t too extreme for fires (so not deserts, stony summits, wetlands, etc.) are fire adapted  \u0026ldquo;Fire season is 13 months\u0026rdquo;\n  CA has a diverse ecosystem; each site is similar to another one elsewhere though What sets CA apart is the scale and intensity of it\u0026rsquo;s fires    CA\u0026rsquo;s fires are unique in that they lead national discourse Texas views the US as France views the EUnion \u0026ndash; a canvas to project it\u0026rsquo;s ideals Alaska view the US as a source of subsidies. It\u0026rsquo;s isolated and treated almost as a commonwealth. California shares sizes, political isolation, and sense of selfhood with the aforementioned.  Unlike AL, it has a strong and wide economy Unlike TX, it has been independent but not secessionist and, while CA and TX both have strong cultures, CA doesn\u0026rsquo;t project its   Importance - 1/9 Americans live in CA - 8th largest economy - Social uses 1/2 the national fire budget - Source (and testing ground) of new firefighting technology  \u0026ldquo;CA is like the rest of the US, just more so\u0026rdquo;\n     Two CA  North and south Sierra and Seacoast Rich and poor Scrubland, megalopolis, \u0026amp; wilderness Lowest and highest elevation in nation (Mount Whitney @ 14,500 ft and Death Valley @ -280 ft)   Sierra Nevada is analogous to NoCal  Big tilt Highest in SE and slants lower to N + W Mostly timber More frequent fires   Transverse Range is analogous to SoCal  Big Kink Highest in E, bends sharp W then trails to pacific and N Mostly bush More intense fires 56% of ppl live on 8% of land      CA is a national innovator  Created geological survey in 1860 Created Board of Forestry in 1885 Set standard for fire control   Light-burning controversy  Pro-burn:  Frontier practices (the Indian way of forest management) Advocated for regular burning montane woods and lowlands NoCal   Pro-protection  Use govt to prevent\\fight fires SoCal   National issue debated in CA 1923: Light-burning anathematized      Leopold report, Wilderness Act, and Tall Timbers fire ecology conferences  Began in 1962 Aimed to transform fire control into fire management Good for conservation + private land owners who wanted traditional working landscapes Loggers and ranchers started moving out at this time Didn\u0026rsquo;t target urban areas   Urban Areas  Used fire suppression  CA to spawn as AK to wilderness\n  Fires in SoCal rained embers onto cities SoCal retaliated w larger firefighting force   New Practices  Operation Firestop: Transform tech into operational programs 1956: Aerial tankers used to drop retardant on firelines 1961: Specialty fire crews expanded nationally 1963: Forest Service opened Western Fire Lab to coordinate fire suppression w air attacks 1970: Organized SoCal fire agencies towards common practices   Area Specialty  Florida: Prescribed fire N Rockies: Management over back countries (So)Cal: Fire suppression  Land management in Cali was synonymous to fire management, thus fire suppression        As CA grew, the motivation for fire suppression was primarily economical This lead to divisive debates of suppression vs let-burn  When there were flames, it was fight or flight   Many fire ideas spread from CA  Often transformed and simplified      Fires are especially susceptible due to Scioecological Systems (SES)  History of fires suppression Climate change More extreme fire weather Expanding development Droughts   Difficult to predict future fire regimes well Changes in human behavior can amplify, but tend to cancel out climatic effects on fire regimes  For example, humans alter through changing land use, ignitions, fuel conditions, or fire suppression Fire activity is influenced by climate variability  More (less) fire occurred in dry (wet) and warm (cool) years, and high-fire years were preceded by moist and sometimes cool conditions 1\u0026ndash;4 y earlier.   (Sierra Nevada) fire-regime shifts correlate to SES changes, not shifts in climate.   Are best bet is to look at history and see how fire regimes changed from past changes in socioeconomic variables  Climate increased fire activity on a large-scale after Native American depopulation reduced the buffering effect of due to their burnings  Sierra Nevada tribes were hunter-gatherers who used sophisticated burning practices to manage resources The fire index nearly doubled after depopulation   Later Euro-American settlement and fire suppression buffered fire activity from temperature increases  Logging, fire suppression, livestock increase (grazing effects)     The overall sensitivity of fire regimes to low-frequency temperature variation is related to temperature-driven vegetation changes that alter fuel structure and fuel type  Peopling of North America #   Traditional Perspective \u0026ndash; Clovis First Model  13,000 ka, there was an ice-free corridor that opened up and let people come to north America  People from Asia follow herds of megafauna across Bering Strait ( Beringia)   We have found kill sites across America  Butchered mammoth, horses, bison, ground sloths, etc.     New Thoughts about Peopling of Americas: Multiple Migrations of People 20,000-40,000 years ago Coastal Migration Model:  Use Boats to Come to Americas from Asia Some travels may not have been successful which is why there is less evidence for this theory Based on:  Evidence sophisticated cultures  Art, pottery, (primitive) technology, etc.   Evidence of maritime seafaring at early date (Australia, New Guinea, Japan) People follow the Kelp Highway Maritime  Kelp forests very productive (food source) Kelp Highway went along Pacific Rim        Peopling of California #    Earliest well dated sites in CA (13,000-10,000 BP) [Based on radio carbon dates]\n Sites located in SoCal: Channel Islands, South Coast These Islands have always been separated by water so we know people had boats relatively early    Find Evidence of Shell Middens\n Contain shell, fish, other maritime foods Have evidence of tools for kelp + technology Big Game Kill Sites rare in California Dietary Differences (Midwest/Plains vs California)  Perhaps because of dietary differences Suggests different groups of people, so potentially different groups of migrants      Major Changes observed on Channel Islands\n Changes in Fauna (Pygmy Mammoths) Changes in Flora Evidence of Fires!    Debate about what caused these changes\n Due to\u0026hellip;  Climate Change  Climate change at end of Ice Age  Mega herbivores died after ice age, increasing fuel sources (vegetation) which we can see with charcoal signatures   Causes warming + drying (leading to fire) Changes in vegetation and animals because they couldn\u0026rsquo;t adapt   Comet  Newest theory Estimated that 5km comet hit earth somewhere We\u0026rsquo;ve found comet-diamonds and various sites that have chemical signatures potentially from a comet Cloud from comet would have affected photo-synthetic processes, killing plants + animals   People  People may have over-hunted animals May have brought fire with them     Potentially due to multiple reasons Kent thinks it\u0026rsquo;s likely climate change + people    Concluding Points\n Clearly people knew about fire from earliest times Very Sophisticated Maritime Peoples (Kent‚Äôs opinion) Early for early anthropogenic Influenced fire regimes from earliest times Implications: the Holocene Epoch in CA (last 10,000 years); you cannot assume That only Natural Fire Regimes existed Must consider the influence of people    Historical Fire Records in California #  Methods #   Key Question: What methods can we use to get historical information on fires?  1. Coring Lakes #    Annual layers are laid down in some lakes  Realistically you can date to around fifty years of accuracy This samples have deeper temporal depth vs other methods We can also radiocarbon date these samples to determine the time period   What to sample  Charcoal present is indicates fire  Larger particle tend to travel small distances Smaller particles can travel much longer distances Some plants may be easier/harder to identify than others   Pollen analysis can give you knowledge on what (wind pollinated) plants were common at the time in that area  Provides broad perspective of vegetation over time Pollen can travel far, so resolution isn\u0026rsquo;t great   Phytoliths  Tiny particles formed in many plants They don\u0026rsquo;t break down \u0026ndash; can stay in soil for hundreds to thousands of years! Can be used to identify plant species Cons: Not all plants produce them; overrepresented in grasses      2. Coring Trees #    You basically jab a metal straw into a tree and get a sample of the tree  Doesn\u0026rsquo;t harm tree, tree naturally patches the hole itself   These sample contain rings Give us age and growth rate of the tree  Growth increase in rings can allude to neighboring trees being killed Dead neighboring trees means less canopy blocking sunshine and less trees competing for nutrients   Multiple samples can give us an overview of a landscape  Do we see a multi-age forest? Do we see synchrony in growth rate?   Crossdating: To identify events, we compare the sample\u0026rsquo;s tree rings to those of other \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; trees in different areas at the same time    Note that the example above is a rare occurrence  3. Fire Scars #    Fire scars occur when fire kills part of the cambium below bark, leaving a wound  The scar itself takes ~10 years to show up   Multiple dated wounds allude to multiple fire occurrences You can also get the seasonality too  Spring trees have warmer water so the scars are lighter in color Fall/winter trees have slower cell movement, so the scars are darker (this is called \u0026ldquo;latewood\u0026rdquo;) Therefore, how deep the scar is in the wood corresponds to the season the fire occurred   Use crossdating for high accuracy and precision Pines, White oaks, Sequoia, Redwood, Incense, and Cedars are all good trees to take samples from Wedges:  You can take wedges from the tree to get access to the ring view Both living and dead wood samples can be dated Pines, redwood, cedar, giant sequoia are all rot resistant thus good species to sample You ideally want to cut a thin wedge that has a large surface area and includes center of tree   Downsides  Trees heal covering up scars or scars are in an exposed cavity that can be seen Problem when fire interval \u0026lt; 10 years (such as cultural burnings)  Most of the time fires aren\u0026rsquo;t severe enough to scare deeply enough and if they do scar, it\u0026rsquo;s feint Only 5% of trees sampled scarred in Sierra Nevada   Fire scars have a finite lifespan (tree lifespan) Paints picture only of a certain plant in the landscape    Fire History Study Sierra Nevada #   Two large sampling areas, one north and south Sierra Nevada Systematic fire history sample in mixed conifer forests Important confluence of at least 3 Tribes: Sierra Miwok, Yokut, and Western Mono.  Burned extensively for multiple objectives This periodic burning limited severity of fires   Fire area did not exceed 1500 ha in any year.  Approximately 50% of area This is tiny compared to the scale of other fires in California!    Area burned in California #   Before 1800  Lightning fire Indian burning  Burned most of grasslands, wetlands, oak woodlands, some forests   4.5 million acres/yr. burned    Costal California Today #   Large area: scotia to Morro bay Very diverse vegetation type  From mixed conifer to costal prairie Fire regimes depend on vegetation, thus they\u0026rsquo;re diverse Likewise, some regions don\u0026rsquo;t consider burning at all and only do suppression whereas others use burnings frequently   General ignition sources  At higher mountains, lighting ignition occurs (still rare, however) At lower elevations / costal areas, human ignition is the main sources  Looking at history, we see that Indian fires dominated for thousands of years     Sudden oak death (SOD) in Tanoak Forest  Invasive pathogen in Marin Country Dead trees increase the severity of fires   Prescribed fire periods  Done in fall if not drying to damage trees  Trees are in dormant phase, less damaging   Done in spring if trying to control/limit  Wet spring conditions are easier to manage      Location Types #   Costal Prairie  Interval: Short  Frequent fires critical to killing shrubs/trees Therefore, due to human intervention douglas-fir and shrublands have began to take over prairies   Source: Indian Type: high \u0026ndash;

Coyote Bush (Oakland hills)  Interval: Moderate Severity: High Size: Moderate Source: Indian burnings for diverse objectives   Oak Woodlands, Mixed Oak Woodland  Severity: Low  Have thick, adapted bark   Frequency: High Size: Small Naturally dense  Very dense nowadays due to lack of Indian burnings Dense locations are less productive than managed and open areas   Mosaic of vegetation patches created that limit fire spread   Chaparral  Interval: Low-Moderate  Frequent burnings can lead to (invasive) grassland conversion (especially in SoCal) Many other \u0026ldquo;fire follower\u0026rdquo;

neighboring people would grow corn, beans, squash but Indians chose not to practice agriculture Perception about Non-Agrarian people Changed over time  (Falsely) Seen initially as passive foragers that minimal impact to environment      Indigenous Stewards of Land and Sea #   Better way of describing CA Indians (compared to hunter gatherers) Indians worked/work as Active Agents to Augment Environmental Productivity and Diversity Seascape Stewardship: Various ways Native people enhanced the productivity and sustainability of shellfish populations and fisheries Landscape Stewardship: Anthropological Rethinking back to 1940s, picks up steam in 1970s, 1980s that culminates with Anderson 2005 publication Various Methods Employed in Landscape Management Practices:  Transplanting Water Diversion Pruning/Coppicing Weeding/Tillage Sowing/Broadcasting Seeds All for the purpose of enhancing productivity of natural plants/animals   Most Important: Anthropogenic or Cultural Burning was the key method of stewardship  Long History in California (Channel Islands)? Mediterranean Climate is Fire Enabler  Wet cool winters lead to high plant production Dry and drought-ful summers provide a dry, extensive fuel base   Native Californians realized that fire was a natural occurrence and learned to live with fire Reasoning for Cultural Burnings (Landscape scale)  Fires Control Insects/Pests Remove Detritus, clean-up landscape  Allows light through which leads to healthy growth   Open Pathways Use Fire to Hunt Game (driving animals into traps/valleys) and Insects Produce Straight Stems for cordage, baskets Augment Growth/Diversity of Plants and Animals in Territory  Grasslands and other plants may have deeper roots which make them more difficult to kill   Increases productivity of nutrient rich plants that animals eat  Deer heard sizes are correlated with burnings   Stimulate Growth of broad spectrum of economic resources  Through burning in Patchy Mosaics     How Areas Were Burned  Instigate fire regimes with frequent, small, low-intensity surface burns  Seasonality of burning very important to minimize risk of catastrophic fires Additionally, risk reduced by reduce fuel loads + creating fuel breaks   Burn to increase productivity and stimulate growth of broad spectrum of economic resources  Notably shrubs with berries, oak woodlands, coniferous   Intentionally create Patchy Mosaics  Increase quantity, diversity and sustainability of key plants and animals Different environments benefit from different style burnings resulting in checkerboard-esque patterns Used for foods, medicines, and raw materials Minimize risk of catastrophic fires due to reduced fuel loads and fire breaks   Burn areas contained by natural rivers/hills/ridges/basalt flows   Implications of Cultural Burning  Not Pristine Wilderness, but Managed Anthropogenic Landscape \u0026ndash; you have to take into account Indians when looking at CA\u0026rsquo;s landscape You can\u0026rsquo;t do restoration without bringing in people  Now, because of a lack of recent cultural burnings, some habitats are struggling        Controversy regarding cultural burnings #   Some argue that cultural fires were small in size, near villages, and had little impact on the larger ecosystem Rather, natural fires best explain these fires Evidence Types tend to be soft;  Tribal Oral Traditions have a Short Temporal Depth for cultural burnings  Observations limited primarily to last 250 years   Limitations arise when primarily referring to Ethnohistoric Sources  Ethnohistoric Studies are from (typically Spaniard around 1600-1700) explorers and not trained as anthropologists Accounts tend to be spotty, geographically biased, and not very detailed Sources don\u0026rsquo;t include key fire regime aspects (freq, seasonality, severity, area, synergy) Susceptible to biases, uncertainty, and anecdotes   Ethnographic Studies  Information is word of mouth history from within the tribe that\u0026rsquo;s passed from one generation to another Recorded by anthropologists Information is very brief/general and lacking in our definition of fire regime now Old archeologists may have viewed Indians as hunter/gatherers (which is wrong!) Colonizers prevented cultural fires (fire exclusion)  Fire exclusion is when fire is indirectly removed from the environment  E.x. adding livestock removes fuels, reducing/removing fire E.x. Colonizers removing Natives (for reasons other than their cultural burnings) removed fires, changing fire regime   Whereas fire suppression is mindful + target specifically at stopping fires  E.x. Using firetrucks, airplanes, etc. to stop a fire from spreading E.x laws preventing you from creating fires during the dry season     Thus, when we started Ethnographic studies in 1901(ish), we didn\u0026rsquo;t see the history before because current tribes weren\u0026rsquo;t allowed to perform cultural burnings     Instead, critics would like to see hard ecological data (fire scars, pollen analysis, charcoal accumulation, phytoliths) Two main reasons to address these criticisms  Differential impacts due to colonialism in different spaces and at different times  Some areas colonized much earlier than others in the state  Central and Souther coast colonized 2.5 centuries ago by Spaniards Others only were colonized during the gold rush)   Some tribes subjected to Fire Exclusion/Suppression policies  Lacking specific information about when these policies were enacted Tribes colonized during gold rush tend to have more information than those colonized earlier in time   Consequently, some tribes have not been able to practice Cultural burning for generations   Political Implications  Some scholars argue that there is no real evidence that Native people were good stewards of the land  Point to times when animals/plants went extinct   Consequently, they should not play a special role in decision making Ecological restoration projects today  Nor play much of a role in the management of our public Lands today        Eco-archaeological Research #   Eco-archaeological Research: When we bridge ecological studies with anthropological / archeological studies and native Oral traditions Tries to tackle Major Challenge of Eco-Archaeological Research: Differentiating Natural Fire Regimes from Anthropogenic Fire Regimes  Compare Expected Fire Regime from Lightning Strikes with Observed Fire Regime Based on multiple lines of evidence         Long-Term Diachronic Approach that Employ Multiple Lines of Evidence:  Native Oral Histories/Traditions Ethnohistorical Accounts Ethnographic Studies Ecological Studies of Fire Archaeological Research  Other methods   Involves Researching with Tribes  Two Case Studies #  1. Sierra Nevada Mountains #   Difficult to carry out research because of high ignition rate due to lightening being common  Hard to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic fires   Research done by Linn Gassaway  Specifically looks at Yosemite Valley which Home of Southern Sierra Miwok people Utilized Ethnohistory, Ethnography, Archaeology, Dendroecology (Fires Scars)   Lightning Fires less Frequent in Valley Floor, more common on mountain peaks  Natural Fire Regime in the valley has a Long Interval Between Lightning Ignited Fires   Three Basic Findings By Gassaway:  Fires more Frequent for prehistoric, protohistoric historic times than expected for Natural Fires Alone  Evidence for potential Cultural Burning   Still evidence of fire activity in 1800s (When Native peoples were removed)  Miwok people still maintaining traditional fire practices?   1890s: Fire frequency reduced when Military takes over administration of Yosemite Valley \u0026ndash; Evidence for Fire Suppression    2. Eco-Archaeological Study of Central Coast of CA #   Research done by John Keeley  Central Coast great place to do study of Cultural Burning Hypothesis Presented for Strong Likelihood of Cultural Burning Here Low Frequency of Lightning on Coast  Natural Fire Return Interval around 50 to 100 Years Greater Bay Area: About 2-5 lightning ignitions per hundred kilometers squared per century   Conditions of high frequency (around 5 years) fire interval (cultural burnings)  Forests dominated by Douglas fir would be suppressed Redwood (fire adapted) forests would remain dominant, but have a more open understory with less fuel Shrublands would be suppressed and costal parries would take over   Conditions of low frequency fire interval (natural)  Shrublands and forests would be common      Central California Coast Project  Amah Mutsun Tribal Band  Issues of Food Security and Food Sovereignty  Limited Access to Native Foods Do not own much property   Tribe has Commitment to Ecological Restoration  Want to return indigenous plants and animals to the land     Established the Amah Mutsun Land Trust (AMLT)  Purpose is to restore natural resources Purpose it to steward lands and waters Return to path of traditional ecological knowledge   AMLT working with resource agencies who own much of the land (CA State Parks, BLM, etc.)  AMLT also working to purchase land for the tribe   Established Native Stewardship Corps  Boots on the ground for ecological restoration   Amah Mutsun Tribe interested in Collaborative Work  Legacy of Colonialism Tribe working with collaborative team to bring Knowledge of indigenous stewardship practices out of dormancy Opportunity to integrate Indigenous Science With Western Science   Amah Mutsun work with Team of Scholars from UCB, UCSC, and California State Parks Three components of project  Synthesize Previous Work:  Ethnohistory, Ethnographic Observations, Tribal Oral, Traditions, Historical Fire Ecology Cuthrell: Early Spanish explorers demonstrate extensive grasslands that must have been maintained through prescribed cultural burnings, as well as established Indigenous burning systems   Undertake Field/Lab work‚ÄîFire Ecology Studies:  Take samples of Fire Scars (Redwoods), Pollen/Charcoal, Phytoliths, Lake Cores Cuthrell: Phytolith Data from soil cores in Quiroste Valley indicate a long term history of grassland vegetation over the last ~1500 years   Archaeology  Archaeology provides understanding of past cultural practices (e.g., tools, settlements) Emphasis on recovering floral and faunal remains; evidence of kinds of resources harvested; Intersection of Archaeology with Fire Ecology; When we see changes in fire regimes, vegetation \u0026ndash; Do we see changes in kinds of resources harvested As outcome of landscape stewardship?

Ostrander attacked ‚Äòprotectionist‚Äô policy of fire control as worse than effective because it allowed fuel to accumulate US National Academy of Science committee on forest reserves urged fire control policy   1908:  Gene Tolly: Sierra National Forest Ranger from 1905-1912 and cowboy assigned to range management for USFS Gifford Pinchot: 1st Chief of the USFS Tolly took Gifford on a back country trip through the Sierra National Forest to try and convince him to allow Indian Burning to keep meadows and forests from getting overgrown but Gifford didn\u0026rsquo;t buy it   1910:  Sunset magazine was an outlet used for forestry discussion at the time  G.L. Hoxie wrote in the magazine to advocated light burning claimed it should not be merely acceptable but made mandatory Made economic, not ecological argument   Unfortunately at same time, Great Idaho Fire occurred  Burned 3 million acres and killed 85 people. Happened due to drought period with ignitions from lightning, locomotives, and logging Resulted in national debate:  Senator Weldon Heyburn (R-Idaho) led effort to disband the USFS so that private land owners could manage their own land Others argued that the newly found US Forest Service (1905) should be expanded so that it could prevent future fires (happened, turns out govt tends to only grow bigger)       1930s: Two experiments were occurring in northeast CA around this time  Full Control  McCloud River Lumber Company Use trains, hand crews, etc   Light Burning  Thomas Barlow (T.B.) Walker was raised from Minnesota and ran the Red River Lumber Co. near Lake Almanor Clinton Walker (T.B‚Äôs son) wrote a letter to the Red River Lumber Company in 1938 (years after he had left the Company) saying:  The general condition of the forests when the white man first came into CA was very excellent Then came the foresters from Yale University and put the tourniquet on the forests Would prefer to remove the tourniquet in our timber matters [which] is the lack of fire I requested permission [to burn] from the State Forester and the USFS DuBois. Both refused We proceeded to burn anyway, and Chief Forester Graves came out from Washington and DuBois and many others with cameras and notebooks to get damaging evidence They stayed several days and followed the burning, with comment by Graves that the work was excellent DuBois apologized to me for panning me in the newspapers previously   Graves suggested that T.B underwrite a chair of fire protection at Yale University  Walker agreed, contributing $100,000 (a huge amount of funding 1900\u0026rsquo;s). Harvey Chapman hired who was huge force in longleaf pine is southeast US       Over the next decade trials done across the US, especially in pine belts of the West and South Stuart Show (from Stanford btw) looked for light burning area around Mt.

The only dishonest thing we did was to pile some pine limbwood in big fire scars of a few large pines, with the gratifying result that they burned down and became damage statistics‚Äù\n  Dave Rogers already had made up his mind regarding light burnings  ‚ÄúWent over nonchalantly to reburn Snake Lake (in 1920). It would have been O.K. except that Plumas Supervisor Dave Rogers came out the night of the burn, grabbed a brush burning torch and ended up stringing fire outside the line on two opposite ends. Then he left.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can understand our deep affection for Dave and the Plumas‚Äù\n  The use of fire in forest management was not given an objective evaluation anywhere in the Western US including Indigenous burning     1940s: Harold Biswell was a professor in the Berkeley Forestry Department from 1947 - 1972  Biswell conducted prescribed fire research in the forests of Georgia from 1942 to 1947 when he was a researcher for the US Forest Service Southern Research Station Began prescribed fire work in Ponderosa pine forests in 1951 (Boggs Mountain near Middletown as well as Teaford Ranch in the Southern Sierra near Bass Lake)  Both of these locations were private land because no government agency would let him burn in public land   Said in his 1958 paper:  \u0026ldquo;At the time the idea of burning was fairly new to me and I looked upon fire as the arch enemy of forests and forestry\u0026rdquo;\n  His 1958 paper showed it was possible to use fire in CA forest management and warned about future problems if fuels were not reduced  His conclusions were very controversial at the time His PhD students recall  \u0026ldquo;There was little opposition to him burning in grasslands and shrublands, but when he began burning experiments in ponderosa pine forests, active and open criticism of him and his work exploded. He was referred to as ‚ÄúHarry the Torch,‚Äù ‚ÄúBurn-Em-Up Biswell,‚Äù and other derisive names, and not always behind his back\u0026rdquo;\n  No forestry faculty would work with Biswell.  UCB Forestry faculty voted to forbid him or his graduate students to work at Blodgett Forest (Scott\u0026rsquo;s Opinion:) At the very least, some UC Berkeley forestry faculty should have worked cooperatively with Biswell to further explore this topic     In 1973, he was given the Berkeley Citation, awarded for his contribution to the University of California that ‚Äúgo beyond the call of duty and whose achievements exceed the standards of excellence in their fields.‚Äù  He was the first UCB forestry professor to get this award      Early Foresters and Fire (10/6) #   Some debate, but suppression wins in 1910s  However, one exception: Southern US continues to use fire   Pre WWII:  1933: Civilian Conservation Corps labor (CCC) used to fight fires  Hired many people due to great depression   1935: 10 AM (National) Policy: All fires should be out by 10AM the day after they\u0026rsquo;re detected before conditions that would make fire more severe arise   During WWII  Firefighting resources (people, machines) tied up with the war  Consensus objectors put into fire fighting crews Many were ridiculed but they fought the fire with little technology and overhead   Japanese sub fires shell near Santa Barbara  Fear of Los Padres NF and others being burned   Japanese also launch fire balloons  Hundreds hit the US, but they\u0026rsquo;re kept hidden from public   Public urged to be careful and fire is connected to the war USFS organizes Cooperative Forest Fire Protection Campaign  Fire protection was framed as National Security through public campaigns Huge push to save resource during the war  ‚ÄúCareless matches aid the Axis‚Äù ‚ÄúOur carelessness, their secret weapon‚Äù   Bambi brought (in 1944)  Movie showed terrible fires started by hunters Only on loan from Disney for 1 year   Smokey Bear named in 1945  Named after asst.

Minimal Reservation Land Implications for Indigenous Stewardship Practices; #   Fewer Restrictions on Indian Trust/Reservation Lands However, Lack of Tribal Lands in California  Curtailed ability of tribes to Revitalize Landscape Practices, such as Cultural Burning   Compare California with Trust Lands in American Southwest!!  3. Native People Lost Access To Resources From Their Tribal Lands #   Major problem for tribes‚Äîthey were not granted trust land (reservations) AND they had minimal access to resources on Public Lands (California State Parks, BLM, National Park Service, US Forest Service) Until Recently ‚Äì Tribes not allowed to undertake Stewardship practices on Public Lands  no cultural burning no harvesting of foods, medicines, raw materials    4. Conservation Practices: Exclusion Of Native People (Anderson 2005, Johnson 2014 Readings) #   Influence of John Muir on Conservation Movement in USA in early 1900s  Early debate about conservation practices involving light burning, indigenous stewardship Believed land was cathedral of nature and should be untouched (so no Indian burning!)   John Muir:  Argued for creations of pristine, natural preserves untouched by people Did not Advocate for Native Stewardship Practices, such as Cultural Burning Conservation Model ‚Äì- Put Fence Around Property and keep people out Fire Suppression Policies of Settler colonialism  One component of broader package of developments that have kept tribes from revitalizing cultural burning until recently     Policies of extermination, genocide; poverty, diseases, food shortages; limited sized reservations; many California tribes unacknowledged; massive environmental destruction of tribal lands Upshot of Discussion, up until the 1960s-1970s, Native Californians had little or no land to call their own, minimal tribal land, little access to resources on Public Lands in California for harvesting foods, medicines, raw materials for baskets, etc. Greatly curtailed ability to undertake Indigenous Landscape Stewardship Practices, such as Cultural Burning  Outline Fire Suppression Policies of US/CA Governments #   Nathanial Kenny wrote an article on the US Fire Service  Published in 1956 in National Geographic Argued that at the end of the day, science would be the most crucial role in controlling fires   \u0026ldquo;I don‚Äôt believe that equipment and development alone will show us how to keep having the relatively few big fires‚Ä¶ Researchers must let their imaginations soar for answers that today would seem fantastic\u0026rdquo;\n  Fire Suppression:  Begins around 1905 Approximately 80,000 fires/year today 98-99% of all wildland fires out at less than 5 acres in size 95% of area burned today is from 1-2% of the fires that escape initial attack  Often occurs in terrible conditions   4.5 million acres once burned in CA  Over half Tribal burning \u0026ndash; 10-35% of this area burns today in most years but 2020 will burn this amount for 1st time (Stephens et al. 2007) Size is only one aspect \u0026ndash; what is the fire mortality? what is the distribution? etc.   Not just area burned, burn patterns inside   Historical data yields insight into controls on forest structure in pine-mixed conifer forests  In 1911 photograph and datasets we can see much more sunny forests This is due to more frequent, natural/cultural burnings vs today\u0026rsquo;s fire suppression Kern National Forest Structure and Composition (Stephens et al. 2015)   Southern California and Baja Forests (Stephens et al 2003)  Drought from 1999-2002 in southern California and northwestern Mexico  Only 5 inches of rain one year, driest on record in So Cal mountains another year   Fire suppression and past forest harvesting have increased forest density in So Cal (Minnich et al 1995)  Native bark beetle population increased because of weaker trees   Sierra San Pedro Martir / Northern Baja California  Mediterranean climate Annual precipitation averages 24 in Area has been grazed by livestock Similar to southern California and eastern Sierra Nevada Fire suppression begins in 1970, no harvesting SSPM Mission in 1794 severely impacted populations Within the California floristic province Forested area of around 40,000 acres Fire suppression and past forest harvesting have increased forest density (Minnich et al. 1995) Elevation upper plateau 8800 ft  3 large plateaus, Peninsular Mountains   Jeffrey pine-mixed conifer forests  Similar to souther CA and eastern Sierra Nevada Fire suppression begins in 1970s, no harvesting   3 indigenous cultures used portions of the SSPM outside the winter: Paipai Kiliwa, Nakipa  SSPM Mission in 1794 severely impacted populations Mission lasted 8 years due to extreme climate     SSPM wildfire July 4, 2003  Started in chaparral below forest Fire burned approximately 600 acres  More shrubland than forest burned   Largest fire in 20 years  Occurred at end of sever drought, 1999-2002 Same drought as in SoCal  SoCal drought killed millions of trees w/o fire     Only 20% of trees killed  Jeffrey pine more dominate after fire, trees and seedlings (less white fir, incense-cedar)   Fire was very patchy  Directly linked to heterogeneity of forest structure and fuels pre-fire Mortality very low even after 4 year drought and wildfire (Stephens et al. 2008)   Incredible forest resilience!!

And if so, how? (Big question even for today)   Policies of Park Management  Research, not intuition, should form the basis for all management Agency best to study park management is the National Park Service Management without knowledge would be a dangerous policy indeed   Methods of Habitat Management  Of the methods of manipulating vegetation, controlled use of fire is the most \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; and the cheapest and easiest to apply (easy?? Maybe in the 1960‚Äôs) Forest and chaparral areas protected from fire may require careful advance treatment (Harold Biswell influence?) Trees and mature brush may have to be cut, piled, and burned before ground fire (Harold Biswell did this with his early burning) Once fuel is reduced, periodic burning can be conducted safely and at low expense (Biswell)  Against wind and down hill results in slowest and least severe fire conditions   \u0026ldquo;We are calling for a set of ecologic skills unknown in this country today\u0026rdquo;

 Settler missions went inwards + cared primarily about making money During Missionary trips, Natives were a large part of the workforce and the main purpose to convert them to Christianity   Two sides of light burning controversy:  Natives encouraged to burn so that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t fuel build up, etc. Foresters who opposed ranchers employing any form of burning, called it Paiute Forestry   Settler colonialism impacts  Intersection of many invasive plants/animals that radically altered ecosystem (e.x. cattle) Draining of lakes/dams to flood areas (altering ecosystem) and other forms of land modification for the purpose of agriculture Hydrolic mining leading to soil erosion Logging + clear cutting of forests   Anderson 2005, settler period  Forceful removal \u0026ndash;

Fire is ignited by people by drip torch or helicopter  Whereas cultural burnings exist only for cultural reasons   Prescribed burner must integrate:  Weather (present day and forecast)  Weather has strongest correlation with severity of the fire + it can change rapidly   Topography Fuels (load, moisture content)  Spotting (embers flying across lines) occurs when fuel is very dry   Ignition patterns (how fair is put on the ground)  Art side \u0026ndash; factor you can control E.x. head fires, backing fires, strip-head fires   Crew size and experience, where to assign people Safety (highest priority of all fires) Risk (all fires have risk, goal is to minimize it and have a plan in place to execute if something goes wrong)   Prescribed fire is both art and science  You can use science, but it ultimately depends on land/weather   Biswell did not take measurements  His graduate student Jan van Wagtendonk developed prescriptions for his PhD at UCB    Southeast USA #   Forests, savannas, and grasslands of the southern US, well-established history of fire, whether from lightning, Indigenous ignitions, or Anglo-Europeans Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Carolinas, all have great prescribed burning programs  Carried down from tradition  Burning used to increase productivity of sap for turpentine, decrease hardwoods in timber lots, enhance grazing forage Became a family tradition   Plant adaptations diverse: closed cones, large terminal buds, sprouting, bark thickness  Longleaf pine  Low intensity, frequent surface fire to reduce competition Thick, corky insulating bark Self-pruning at maturity Large terminal bud Chapman studied \u0026ndash; Yale     USFS tried to eliminate but not successful   Kobziar et al.
