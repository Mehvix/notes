# notes

Using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) + [book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/) theme. Feel free to point out or even correct mistakes by creating an [issue](https://github.com/Mehvix/notes/issues/new)/[PR](https://github.com/Mehvix/notes/compare) or through reaching out to any of my contacts listed on [my website](https://www.mehvix.com).

This branch (master) has hugo files, while the [gh-pages branch](../../tree/gh-pages) has the generated site files. This is done automatically with [actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages).
