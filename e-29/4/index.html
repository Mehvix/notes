  Processes based on light-sensitive liquids
  #


  Stereolithography (SLA)
  #


Also called Digital Light Printing (DLP)
Thermoforming molds are most commonly made with stereolithography, i.e orthodontic aligners

Used because the molds need complete geometric customizability


A tray, bath or vat of a photo-sensitive liquid (a resin) is locally crosslinked (solidified) with a scanning laser beam or projected light pattern (i.e 
  Photoinitiator), usually violet (~405 nm) or ultraviolet (~365 nm)
Unwanted bonding can be avoided by making the base oxygen-permeable (e.g. by making it out of an elastomeric material, as in the Carbon 3D systems) since oxygen inhibits the photocrosslinking reaction and an oxygen-rich layer will form in the resin just above the permeable window because of air diffusing through the window



    
- Covalent bonds form between the molecules in the liquid, forming a solid material (this reaction is called photocrosslinking)
    - Absorption of photons as they pass through the liquid limits crosslinking to a small layer (typically tens of μm thick) at a time
- Parts are more [isotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy) (versus FDM), have almost matte finish
- Two machine design approaches:
    1. Right: Light shines up through a window; part gradually drawn up out of a tray of resin
       - Requires more liquid
    2. Projection Printing (below): Light shines down onto liquid surface; platform moves down into the vat as the part builds up
       - Printed object drawn upwards out of tray of resin
       - Separation from tray: peeling or O2-inhibited dead layer

  

    




  







In older SLA configurations, the platform is submerged in the resin, the illumination comes in from above the resin surface, and the platform moves down into the resin bath after each layer was printed. Sometimes a mechanical ‘wiper’ is used to distribute a thin, uniform layer of uncured resin on top of the component before the next exposure step
In new designs, the illumination is shone through a window in the bottom of the resin tray, and the platform moves upwards, pulling the object out of the tray as it prints.

This approach has the advantage of requiring a less deep resin tray, and eliminating the need for a wiper, but means that the machine designer must ensure that the resin does not bond to the window at the base of the resin tray.




  Resin solidification in stereolithography
  #






  Beer-Lambert model: Absorption of the illuminating light means that exposure dose .$E(z)$ (measured in W/m.$^2$) of the light is at its highest at the point where the light enters the resin, and decreases exponentially with depth below resin surface .$z$:
$$E(z) = E_0 e^{-z/D_p}$$

This curve (a property of the dye/resin) follows a first-order 
  exponential decay

This is common across most materials that absorb light; for each unit traveled by the photon, there&rsquo;s a finite probability of getting absorbed.
E.x. 10% of photos are absorbed in the first 10 microns, 10% of the remaining photons in the next 10 microns, etc.







    
- A newer, potentially faster, approach for processes that rely on photocrosslinking is to expose each  2D layer in one single exposure step, rather than scanning a beam of light. The digital micromirror  devices that are an integral component of modern video projectors can be used to pattern the  photocrosslinking wavelength of light. Even with this layer-by-layer approach, there is still a need to
- Whether 3D printing will always involve this slicing approach is an open question. Since slicing often imparts anisotropic mechanical properties to printed components and limits their layer-to-layer strength, there may be a strong case for developing full 3D control over the material deposition process, so that, for example, the deposition head would move in the x, y and z directions simultaneously. Path planning to avoid collision between the machine and the component would be a significant challenge slice a 3D object into multiple 2D images.

  

    



    
  




.$D_p$ is the penetration depth, a resin property

The resin at a particular location will photocrosslink when the total illumination dose exceeds a critical value called the curing dose
The depth into the resin at which the curing dose is reached is termed the curing depth


.$E$ is the dose: the time integral of power intensity over the layer time

Measured in J/m.$^2$
In projector-based systems, the source is .$E_0 = I_0\ t_\text{layer}$

.$I_0$ is the illumination irradiance/power intensity, which is proportional to the energy of the incoming particles per area W/m.$^2$


In laser-scanning systems, .$E_0$ is a function of illumination power intensity (W/m.$^2$), beam diameter w (m), and scanning speed, v (m/s):

  





    
- Gelation just occurs at the **curing depth**, .$D_c$ where the resin receives the **curing dose**, .$E_c$:
    $$E_c = E_0 e^{-D_c/D_p} \Longrightarrow D_c = D_p \ln \bigg( \frac{E_0}{E_c} \bigg)$$




  

    
- Cured material may not be very strong at curing depth, so layers typically overlap in .$z$ direction to ensure material is all well-gelled



- Thermal and light curing are done to finish these surfaces

- Whether 3D printing will always involve this slicing approach is an open question. Since slicing often imparts anisotropic mechanical properties to printed components and limits their layer-to-layer strength, there may be a strong case for developing full 3D control over the material deposition process, so that, for example, the deposition head would move in the x, y and z directions simultaneously.

- Atoms or molecules at the contacting interfaces between particles diffuse faster in the elevated temperature and cause adjacent particles to connect to each other.
- Powder particles are heated enough that surfaces melt-- atoms/molecules at their surfaces interdiffuse, bonding the particles.
- Because the powder is not fully melted, parts usually retain some porosity
- Can weaken the component compared to continuous bulk material

- Removes porosity by melting the particles
- Thermal gradients can be a problem
- Computer generators now account for thees gradients and deformations
- Changes pattern order and energy distribution
- There has been a move away from metal SLS towards complete melting of the metal powder that is being fused.
- Greater control of grain structure and lower porosity than with selective laser sintering
- Fully dense structures achievable
- Scanning laser beam completely melts the powder during processing
- No binders being employed but rather the structure of the component being built up directly from metal.
