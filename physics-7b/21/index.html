  21.1 Static Electricity; Electric Charge and its Conservation
  #


&ldquo;Charged&rdquo; objects posses a net electric charge
Unlike charges attract; like charges repel

Charges on glass are positive, charges on plastic is negative


Law of Conservation of Electric Charge:

Whenever a certain amount of charge is produced in one object, an equal amount of the opposite type of charge is produced in another object

Charges cannot be destroyed or created


E.x. a plastic ruler is rubbed with a paper towel. The plastic acquires a negative charge and the towel obtains an equal positive charge
In other words, the net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero: .$\Sigma Q = 0$




  21.2 Electric Charge in the Atom
  #


Atoms are made up of positive nucleus surrounded by at least one negatively charged electron.

Inside the nucleus are protons which are positively charged and neutrons which have no charge
The charges of electrons and protons are equal in magnitude


E.x. neutral atoms with no charge contain an equal number of protons and electrons
When an atom gains a charge (by losing/gaining electrons), it then has a net charge and is called an ion
Neutral objects have a net charge of zero

Over time, objects left alone with a charge tend to lose their charge
This is because over time, electrons are exchanged with water molecules in the air

Water molecules are polar: They are neutral, their charges aren&rsquo;t equally distributed


Thus, on rainy days it&rsquo;s harder for an object to maintain a charge for too long




  21.3 Insulators and Conductors
  #


Conductor: Material that allow charge to flow between objects

Metals tend to be good conductors
Electrons (charges) are relatively lose: can move freely within metal, but can&rsquo;t leave easily

Called free or conduction electrons




Insulator: Opposite of conductors; don&rsquo;t easily allow a flow of charge

Most materials other than metals tend to be good insulators

Notably rubber and wood


Electrons are bound very tightly to the nuclei
Almost no free electrons


Semiconductors: Somewhere between the two former

Silicon, germanium
Less free electrons than a conductor, but more than an insulator




  21.4 Induced Charge; Electroscope
  #


Conduction: Charge transfer by physical contact

E.x. a positively charged metal rod touches a neutral metal rod. Free electrons from the neutral rod will then flow (transfer) to the charged rod, leaving the formerly neutral rod now slightly positively charged


Induction: Charge distribution altered by bringing two objects close, but not touching

Unlike conduction, induction doesn&rsquo;t alter the net charge of objects when the inducer is taken away
However, induction can redistribute the existing charges on the induced object


Grounded Objects

Objects can be ground to the earth with a conducting wire
The earth is very large and can conduct, so it easily accepts/gives up electrons
Therefore, when an object is induced by another charged object, the original objects will become charged
If the wire is ever cut when the object is under induction, the charge will stay in the object

- .$\vec F \propto \text{angle of deflection}$
- .$y$-axis: .$F_{T1} \sin \theta_1 = F_{21}$
- .$x$-axis: .$F_{T1} \cos \theta_0 = m_1 g$
- .$F_{21} = m_1 g \tan \theta_1 \approx m_1 g \theta_1$

  21.5 Coulomb&rsquo;s Law
  #


  
**Coulomb's Law:**
$$E_\text{source} = k \frac{Q_\text{source}}{r^2} \Longrightarrow F = EQ = \bigg(k \frac{Q_1}{r^2}\bigg) (Q_2) = k\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$$
where .$k$ is a constant equal to .$\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} = 8.988 \cdot 10^9 \text{ N m$^2$/C$^2$}$




Very similar to 
  universal gravitation equation

However&mldr;

.$F_C$ can repel, whereas .$F_G$ is always attractive
.$F_C$ only acts on charged objects, whereas .$F_G$ acts on neutral objects too


.$F_G/F_C \approx 10^{-40} \Longrightarrow F_C \gg F_G$


The coulomb (.$\text{C}$) is the SI unit for charge
Properties of Coulomb Force:

It can be attractive and repulsive
It is not a contact force
Inversely proportional to .$r^2$
Proportional to amount of charge .$Q$


The smallest charge we&rsquo;ve observed is the elementary charge: .$e = 1.6022 \cdot 10^{-19} \text{ C}$

Electrons have a charge equal to .$-e$
Protons have a charge equal to .$+e = -Q_\text{electron}$
Charges are Quantized

That is, all charges are multiples of .$e$
Since electrons are elementary particles, by definition they can&rsquo;t be divided.




.$k$ can also be written as .$\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}$

.$\varepsilon_0$ is called the 
  permittivity of free space
.$\varepsilon_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi k} = 8.85 \cdot 10^{-12} \text{C$^2$/N m$^2$}$




  21.6 Electric Field
  #


Electric fields extend outward from every charge and permeates all of space
$$\overrightarrow E = \lim_{q\to0}\frac{\overrightarrow F}{q} \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow F = q \overrightarrow E$$

.$q$ is a positive charge
.$\overrightarrow F$ is the forces the field exserts on .$q$
Has units newtons per coulomb (.$\text{N/C}$)


We can combine this with Coulomb&rsquo;s law to get
$$\overrightarrow E = \frac{kqQ/r^2}{q} = k \frac{Q}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r^2}$$

We see that .$\overrightarrow E$ is independent of the non-source particle .$q$
.$Q$ is the particle that is responsible for the field in the first place


An electric field at a given point is the sum of all other electric fields that act on that point
$$\overrightarrow E = \overrightarrow E_1 + \overrightarrow E_2 + &mldr;$$


  21.7 Electric Field Calculations for Continuous Charge Distributions
  #


We can extend our previous definition to calculus as
$$\overrightarrow E = \int d \overrightarrow E = k \int \frac{1}{r^2}\ dq = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \int \frac{1}{r^2}\ dq$$

.$dq = \lambda\ dl \text{ (line)} = \sigma\ dA \text{ (disk)} = \rho\ dV \text{ (sphere)}$




  
**Calculating field generated by a continuous charge distribution**
1. Draw an arbitrary &#34;piece&#34; of charge distribution; don't choose a special point such as the end or exact middle. The piece should be infinitesimally long and/or wide. Thus, its length or width will be something like .$dx$ or .$ds$
2. Write an expression for .$dq$, the corresponding infinitesimal charge of that piece in terms of .$dx$ or .$ds$ or whatever. Recall .$dq = \frac{\text{total charge}}{\text{total length}} \times \text{(tiny length of piece)}$
3. Using Coulomb's law, find the infinitesimal electric field at that point of interest (e.x. some point .$P$) generated by the piece chosen in step 1. When necessary, break .$d\vec E$ into components, .$dE_x$ and .$dE_y$
4. Integrate .$dE_x$ or .$dE_y$ over the whole charge distribution to obtain the total electric field in the .$x$ or .$y$ direction respectively




When solving problems, it&rsquo;s a good idea to use symmetry, check charge direction, and (when applicable) use bounds of .$r \in [0, \infty]$
We can write equation for an infinite plane holding a uniform surface charge density .$\sigma$
$$2A \cdot \overrightarrow E = \frac{\sigma A}{\varepsilon_0} \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow E = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}$$

This also applies in the case where a charge is close to an infinite surface (so that the distance to the surface is much greater than the distance to the edges)
In the case where there are two oppositely charged sheets parallel to one another, the field is .$\vec E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}$ since there are two charges creating the field


The case involving an infinitely long wire can be written generally as
$$\overrightarrow E \cdot 2\pi RL = \frac{\lambda L}{\varepsilon_0} \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow E = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi\varepsilon_0 \cdot r}$$

.$r$ is the distance from a particle to the wire




  21.8 Field Lines
  #



    
- To visualize electric fields, we draw **electric field lines** or **lines of force**
- Three properties of Electric Field Lines:
    1. Electric field lines **indicate the direction of the electric field**; the field points are in the direction tangent to the field line at any point -- see point .$P$ in .$\text{(a)}$
    2. The lines are drawn so that the magnitude of the electric field, .$E$, is proportional to the number of lines crossing unit area perpendicular to the lines (i.e. a circle 'hugging' a point charge). **The closer together the lines, the stronger the field.**
    3. Electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges; and **the number starting or ending is proportional to the magnitude of the charge**.
        - .$\text{Density} = \frac{\text{number of lines crossing surface}}{\text{area surface}}$
        - .$\text{1 Coulomb} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} \cdot \text{ lines}$
        - .$\therefore \text{Density} = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0 4\pi r^2} \Longrightarrow \vec E$
- In the case of two oppositely charged parallel & equally spaces plates -- such as case .$\text{(d)}$ -- we can write the field as
    $$\overrightarrow E =\text{const.} = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}=\frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0 A}$$
    - .$Q =\sigma A$ is the charge on one plate of area .$A$
- Field lines never cross because it wouldn't make sense for an electric field to have two directions at the same point.

  

    




  




  Electric Dipole
  #


A combination of two equal but opposite charges next to one another &ndash; see .$(\text{a})$ above

  Dipole Moment is when represented by vector .$\vec{p}$ of magnitude .$Ql$

Molecules that have dipole moments are called polar molecules





    
![Dipole](/docs/physics-7b/imgs/dipole.png)

  

    
- A dipole in a uniform electric field feels no net force, but does have a net torque (unless .$\vec p \parallel \vec E$)
- If .$\vec p \not \parallel \vec E$, .$W =\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \tau d\theta$ where .$\tau = -\vec p\vec E\sin\theta = \vec p \times \vec E$
    - Simplifies to .$W =\vec p\vec E(\cos\theta_2 - \cos\theta_1)$
    - Thus, work/torque is most at .$\theta = 90^\circ$ or .$180^\circ$ depending on .$\vec E$ direction
    - Pay attention to right hand rule when solving
- If .$r \gg l \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow E \propto 1/r^3$

  




  21.9 Electric Fields and Conductors
  #


The static electric field inside a conductor is zero (in static situations where electrons have had time to stop moving)

For that reason, any net charge on a conductor distributes itself on the surface
Charges inside conductors act as if the conductor isn&rsquo;t there


All the electric field lines just outside a charged conductor are perpendicular to the surface


  21.10 Motion of Charged Particle
  #


Vector Form of Forces
$$\overrightarrow F_{12} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \cdot \widehat r_{21}$$

Notation:

.$\overrightarrow F_{12}$ means force on .$q_1$  by  .$q_2$ since .$q_2$ is the source charge
.$\widehat r_{21} = - \widehat r_{12} \Longrightarrow \overrightarrow F_{12} = -\overrightarrow F_{21}$


Direction

If .$q_1 q_2 > 0$ (same sign, repulse), then the force and unitary vectors both point away from the two charges


    
![Same Signs 12](/docs/physics-7b/imgs/repel-12.png)

  

     
![Same Signs 21](/docs/physics-7b/imgs/repel-21.png)

  







If .$q_1 q_2 < 0$ (opposite sign, attract), then the force vector points towards the two charges and the unitary direction vector still points away from the two charges


    
![Opposite Signs 12](/docs/physics-7b/imgs/attractive-12.png)

  

     
![Opposite Signs 21](/docs/physics-7b/imgs/attractive-21.png)

  



Superposition Principle

In a system considering multiple (3+) charges, forces acting on .$q_1$ by .$q_2$ (.$F_{12}$) is independent from whether other charges are present
Total forces acting on .$Q_1$ can be written as .$\overrightarrow F = \overrightarrow F_{12} + \overrightarrow F_{13} + \dots$

Remember to break down the vectors into .$x/y$ components when adding them

E.x. .$F_{1x} = F_{12x} + F_{13x} + \dots$


Realize that the axis are arbitrary


.$\theta = \tan^{-1}\Big(\frac{F_x}{F_y}\Big)$


Charges in Fields

Charge moving with .$\vec v$ that is parallel to  uniform field .$\overrightarrow E$

.$\overrightarrow F = q \overrightarrow E = m \vec a \Longrightarrow a_x = \frac{q}{m}\overrightarrow E = \text{const.}$
.$\vec v = \sqrt{2a_x \vec d} = \sqrt{\frac{2q}{m}\overrightarrow E_x \vec d}$


Charge moving with .$\vec v$ that is orthogonal to uniform field .$\overrightarrow E$

Similar to projectile in gravitational field: .$\vec g \sim \overrightarrow E$
.$\overrightarrow F_x = 0 \Longrightarrow v_{x2} = v_{x1};\ \ a_x = 0$
.$\overrightarrow F_y = q \overrightarrow E = m a_y;\ \ a_y = \vec a = \frac{q}{m}\overrightarrow E = \text{const.}$
.$y(t) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{q\overrightarrow E}{m}t^2$

1. Draw an arbitrary "piece" of charge distribution; don't choose a special point such as the end or exact middle. The piece should be infinitesimally long and/or wide. Thus, its length or width will be something like .$dx$ or .$ds$
2. Write an expression for .$dq$, the corresponding infinitesimal charge of that piece in terms of .$dx$ or .$ds$ or whatever. Recall .$dq = \frac{\text{total charge}}{\text{total length}} \times \text{(tiny length of piece)}$
3. Using Coulomb's law, find the infinitesimal electric field at that point of interest (e.x. some point .$P$) generated by the piece chosen in step 1. When necessary, break .$d\vec E$ into components, .$dE_x$ and .$dE_y$

- Three properties of Electric Field Lines:
1. Electric field lines **indicate the direction of the electric field**; the field points are in the direction tangent to the field line at any point -- see point .$P$ in .$\text{(a)}$
2. The lines are drawn so that the magnitude of the electric field, .$E$, is proportional to the number of lines crossing unit area perpendicular to the lines (i.e. a circle 'hugging' a point charge). **The closer together the lines, the stronger the field.**
3. Electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges; and **the number starting or ending is proportional to the magnitude of the charge**.
- .$\text{Density} = \frac{\text{number of lines crossing surface}}{\text{area surface}}$
- .$\text{1 Coulomb} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} \cdot \text{ lines}$
- .$\therefore \text{Density} = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0 4\pi r^2} \Longrightarrow \vec E$
- In the case of two oppositely charged parallel & equally spaces plates -- such as case .$\text{(d)}$ -- we can write the field as
$$\overrightarrow E =\text{const.} = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}=\frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0 A}$$
- .$Q =\sigma A$ is the charge on one plate of area .$A$
- Field lines never cross because it wouldn't make sense for an electric field to have two directions at the same point.</div><div class="flex-even markdown-inner" style=flex-grow:1><figure><img src=/docs/physics-7b/imgs/field-lines.png></figure></div></div><h2 id=electric-dipole>Electric Dipole
