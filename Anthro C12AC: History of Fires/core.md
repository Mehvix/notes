# Anthropocene:

-   The time when human activity began to have an influence on (global) landscape due to our use of fire
-   Large subject used in a range of fields -- no single definition
-   Defining feature: combustion of carbon and greenhouse gases
-   Ice core measurement technique
    -   As ice forms, methane and $CO_2$ get trapped along with ash/dust/pollen which scientists can measure
    -   Ice can be dated so we can compare these variables so we can see change in greenhouse gases over time
-   Beginning is disputed
    -   Industrial revolution (1780s)
        -   Most popular among scholars
    -   Atomic Testing (1940s)
    -   Stages idea:
        1. 1.8 million years ago: When fire was discovered
        2. 6000-4000s years ago: With neolithic agriculture
        3. 1780s: Industrial revolution

# Pyrogeography:

-   History of the variation of fire activity over space and time at the landscape scale in different regions of the world
-   Pyrogeography started in [Silurian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian) when plant life began
-   Fire requirements: $13\%\ O_2$ in a normal environment and $30\%$ in damp vegetation.
-   Fires are a selection force in the evolution of plants

# Four phases for Pyrogeography

1. Natural Biospheric Fire -- Natural Fire Regime

    - (Potential) start date for pyrogeography
    - During [Silurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian) and Devonian Periods (440-400 HYA)
    - Natural fire regime started during this period because it was the first time that the fire triangle came together
    - Fire triangle:
        - _Ignition Source_: (Since beginning) Natural ignition from lightening, volcanoes, (rarely) falling rock sparks
        - _Oxygen Source_: (Cambrian period) Atmospheric Oxygen leads to appearance of photosynthetic organisms
        - _Fuel Source_: (Silurian and Devonian Periods) Terrestrial plants
    - During this time, natural fire regimes evolved
        - As coal became more common (Carboniferous period), fires did too

2. Wildland Anthropogenic Fire -- Hunter/Gatherer Fire Regime

    - When people began acting as the _ignition source_
    - Cooking hypothesis
    - Primarily used fire for domestic cases
        - Heating, cooking, warmth, etc.
    - When people move to a new land

        - Major changes in fauna, vegetation, and fires (charcoal)
        - People seem to bring fire with them as they migrate

    - Start dates
        - 40 ka for Australia
            - 90% of fauna went extinct
            - Lots of evidence of fire
        - 45 ka for Highland New Guinea
        - 50 ka for lowland Borneo
        - 20 ka for the Americas
            - Extinctions of many animals and vegetation
                - Debate: are these because of natural process like climate change (ice age -> post ice age?) or do people play a large role
            - Native Perspective – Indigenous people have been here since time began

3. Agriculture Anthropogenic Fire -- Agricultural Fire Regime
4. Industrial and Domestic Anthropogenic Fire -- Industrial Fire Regime

# Overview of Fires in California

[Conflagrating California](https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1806806/pdf)

-   ~54% of CA ecosystems depend on fire
-   The remaining ecosystems that aren't too extreme for fires (so not deserts, stony summits, wetlands, etc.) are fire adapted
    > "Fire season is 13 months"
-   CA has a diverse ecosystem; each site is similar to another one elsewhere though
-   What sets CA apart is the scale and intensity of it's fires

---

-   CA's fires are unique in that they lead national discourse
-   Texas views the US as France views the EUnion -- a canvas to project it's ideals
-   Alaska view the US as a source of subsidies. It's isolated and treated almost as a commonwealth.
-   California shares sizes, political isolation, and sense of selfhood with the aforementioned.
    -   Unlike AL, it has a strong and wide economy
    -   Unlike TX, it has been independent but not secessionist and, while CA and TX both have strong cultures, CA doesn't project its
-   Importance - 1/9 Americans live in CA - 8th largest economy - Social uses 1/2 the national fire budget - Source (and testing ground) of new firefighting technology
    > "CA is like the rest of the US, just more so"

---

-   Two CA
    -   North and south
    -   Sierra and Seacoast
    -   Rich and poor
    -   Scrubland, megalopolis, & wilderness
    -   Lowest and highest elevation in nation (Mount Whitney @ 14,500 ft and Death Valley @ -280 ft)
-   Sierra Nevada is analogous to NoCal
    -   Big tilt
    -   Highest in SE and slants lower to N + W
    -   Mostly timber
    -   More frequent fires
-   Transverse Range is analogous to SoCal
    -   Big Kink
    -   Highest in E, bends sharp W then trails to pacific and N
    -   Mostly bush
    -   More intense fires
    -   56% of ppl live on 8% of land

---

-   CA is a national innovator
    -   Created geological survey in 1860
    -   Created Board of Forestry in 1885
    -   Set standard for fire control
-   Light-burning controversy
    -   Pro-burn:
        -   Frontier practices
            > the Indian way of forest management
        -   Advocated for regular burning montane woods and lowlands
        -   NoCal
    -   Pro-protection
        -   Use govt to prevent\fight fires
        -   SoCal
    -   National issue debated in CA
    -   1923: Light-burning anathematized

---

-   Leopold report, Wilderness Act, and Tall Timbers fire ecology conferences
    -   Began in 1962
    -   Aimed to transform fire control into fire management
    -   Good for conservation + private land owners who wanted traditional working landscapes
    -   Loggers and ranchers started moving out at this time
    -   Didn't target urban areas
-   Urban Areas
    -   Used fire suppression
        > CA to spawn as AL to wilderness
    -   Fires in SoCal rained embers onto cities
    -   SoCal retaliated w larger firefighting force
-   New Practices
    -   Operation Firestop: Transform tech into operational programs
    -   _1956_: Aerial tankers used to drop retardant on firelines
    -   _1961_: Specialty fire crews expanded nationally
    -   _1963_: Forest Service opened Western Fire Lab to coordinate fire suppression w air attacks
    -   _1970_: Organized SoCal fire agencies towards common practices
-   Area Specialty
    -   Florida: Prescribed fire
    -   N Rockies: Management over back countries
    -   (So)Cal: Fire suppression
        -   Land management in Cali was synonymous to fire management, thus fire suppression

---

-   As CA grew, the motivation for fire suppression was primarily economical
-   This lead to divisive debates of suppression vs let-burn
    -   When there were flames, it was fight or flight
-   Many fire ideas spread from CA
    -   Often transformed and simplified

# Peopling of North America

-   Traditional Perspective – Clovis First Model

    -   13,000 ka, there was an ice-free corridor that opened up and let people come to north America
        -   People from Asia follow herds of megafauna across Bering Strait ([Beringia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia))
    -   We have found kill sites across America
        -   Butchered mammoth, horses, bison, ground sloths, etc.

-   New Thoughts about Peopling of Americas:

    -   Multiple Migrations of People 20,000-40,000 years ago

-   Coastal Migration Model:

    -   Use Boats to Come to Americas from Asia
    -   Some travels may not have been successful which is why there is less evidence for this theory
    -   Based on:
        1.  Evidence sophisticated cultures
            -   Art, pottery, (primitive) technology, etc.
        2.  Evidence of maritime seafaring at early date (Australia, New Guinea, Japan)
        3.  People follow the Kelp Highway Maritime
            -   Kelp forests very productive (food source)
            -   Kelp Highway went along Pacific Rim

# Peopling of California

-   Earliest well dated sites in CA (13,000-10,000 BP) [Based on radio carbon dates]
    -   Sites located in SoCal: Channel Islands, South Coast
    -   These Islands have always been separated by water so we know people had boats relatively early
-   Find Evidence of Shell Middens

    -   Contain shell, fish, other maritime foods
    -   Have evidence of **tools for kelp** + technology
    -   Big Game Kill Sites rare in California Dietary Differences (Midwest/Plains vs California)
        -   Perhaps because of dietary differences
        -   Suggests different groups of people, so potentially different groups of migrants

-   Major Changes observed on Channel Islands
    -   Changes in Fauna (Pygmy Mammoths)
    -   Changes in Flora
    -   Evidence of Fires!
-   Debate about what caused these changes
    -   Due to...
        -   Climate Change
            -   Climate change at end of Ice Age
            -   Causes warming + drying (leading to fire)
            -   Changes in vegetation and animals because they couldn't adapt
        -   Comet
            -   Newest theory
            -   Estimated that 5km comet hit earth somewhere
            -   We've found comet-diamonds and various sites that have chemical signatures potentially from a comet
            -   Cloud from comet would have affected photo-synthetic processes, killing plants + animals
        -   People
            -   People may have over-hunted animals
            -   May have brought fire with them
    -   Potentially due to multiple reasons
    -   Kent thinks it's likely climate _change_ + _people_
-   Concluding Points
    -   Clearly people knew about fire from earliest times
    -   Very Sophisticated Maritime Peoples
    -   (Kent’s opinion) Early for early anthropogenic
    -   Influenced fire regimes from earliest times
    -   Implications: the Holocene Epoch in CA
    -   (last 10,000 years); you cannot assume
    -   That only Natural Fire Regimes existed
    -   Must consider the influence of people
