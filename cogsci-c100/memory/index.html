Three-Stage Model of Memory
<a class=anchor href=#three-stage-model-of-memory>#</a>
</h1><ul>
<li>Three-stage modal model of memory (Atkinson-Shiffrin model):
<ol>
<li>Sensory memory</li><li>Working memory or short-term memory</li><li>Long-term memory</li></ol></li></ul><h2 id=sensory-memory>
Sensory memory
<a class=anchor href=#sensory-memory>#</a>
</h2><ul>
<li>Holds sensory information very briefly (1/2 to 4 secs)
<ul>
<li>Large capacity store</li><li>Sensory input is held very briefly in sensory memory to allow selection and processing of information</li><li>Now often considered to be a part of perception</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=two-types-of-sensory-memory>
Two types of sensory memory:
<a class=anchor href=#two-types-of-sensory-memory>#</a>
</h2><ul>
<li>Iconic memory (photographic memory): visual sensory memory
<ul>
<li>Echoic memory: auditory sensory memory (Eriksen & Collins, 1967)</li></ul></li><li>Eidetic imagery (photographic memory): characterized by relatively long-lasting and detailed images of visual scenes that can sometimes be scanned and &ldquo;looked at&rdquo; as if they had real existence
<ul>
<li>Group of schoolchildren was shown a picture for 30 seconds. Picture was taken away, and children asked whether they could still see anything and, if so, to describe what they saw. Some children showed evidence of this kind of memory.</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>10-year-old boy, looking at blank easel from which a picture of Alice in Wonderland had just been removed, is asked whether he sees something there (on the blank easel)
<ul>
<li>Participant (P): I see the tree, gray tree with three limbs. I see the cat with stripes around its tail.</li><li>Experimenter (E): Can you count those stripes?</li><li>Participant (P): I see the tree, gray tree with three limbs. I see the cat with stripes around its tail.</li><li>Experimenter (E): Can you count those stripes?</li><li>P: Yes (pause). Thereâ€™s about 16.</li><li>E: Youâ€™re counting what? Black, white or both?</li><li>P: Both.</li><li>E: Tell me what else you see.</li><li>P: And I can see the flowers on the bottom. Thereâ€™s about three stems but you can see two pairs of flowers. One on the right has green leaves, red flower on bottom with yellow on top. And I can see the girl with a green dress. Sheâ€™s got blond hair and a red hair band and there are some leaves in the upper left-hand corner where the tree is. (Leask, Haber, & Haber, 1969)</li></ul></li><li>Eidetic imagery is relatively rare &ndash; only 5% or so of tested schoolchildren have it and proportion is much smaller in adults</li><li>It is not an especially useful form of mental activity.</li></ul><ul>
<li>Contrary to popular lore, memory experts donâ€™t generally have eidetic imagery; their skill is in organizing material in memory, rather than in storing it in picture form.</li></ul><h2 id=short-term-memory-stm-or-working-memory>
Short-term memory (STM) or working memory
<a class=anchor href=#short-term-memory-stm-or-working-memory>#</a>
</h2><ul>
<li>Holds items that are actively being thought about
<ul>
<li>Has limited capacity</li></ul></li><li>7 +/- 2 items, e.g., letters, words, dots, though this number can vary by task</li><li>Number of words you can speak in 1.5 seconds
<ul>
<li>Also limited in time, but longer than sensory memory</li></ul></li><li>Lasts 5 to 30 seconds</li><li>Information decays rapidly unless maintained in consciousness through rehearsal
<ul>
<li>Working memory (Baddeley) is now the preferred term because it emphasizes that this is an active, rather than a passive, process
<ul>
<li>Includes a phonological loop (associated with the left hemisphere) that briefly stores sounds, and a visuospatial sketchpad (associated with the right hemisphere) that stores visual and spatial information oTwo visuospatial tasks will interfere with each other if performed simultaneously, as will two items in the phonological loop oHowever, people can perform a verbal task and a spatial task simultaneously</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Episodic buffer: another component of working memory that can hold and combine information from phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad and long-term memory to form a story &ndash; important in time sequencing</li><li>Central executive: integrates information from phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, and episodic buffer oSimilar to attention/sensory memory in Atkinson Shriffin model</li></ul><h2 id=long-term-memory-ltm>
Long-term memory (LTM)
<a class=anchor href=#long-term-memory-ltm>#</a>
</h2><ul>
<li>Repository of all oneâ€™s knowledge
<ul>
<li>Unlimited in the amount it can store</li><li>No time limit</li></ul></li><li>Evidence for short-term memory and long- term memory: serial position effect
<ul>
<li>There is a tendency for people to remember best the items learned first (because of LTM) and the items learned last (because of STM)</li><li>Proactive interference: words from previous lists interfere with your ability to learn new words of a similar nature (doing progressively worse on Lists 2-5)</li><li>Release from PI (doing well on List 6): items are different so no interference</li><li>memory for these items should be good</li><li>Retroactive interference: words from later list interfere with recall of a prior list (difficulty recalling items from List 1 at the end)</li><li>Experiment also shows that semantic similarity of items affects recall</li></ul></li><li>Medical applications of primacy-recency effect
<ul>
<li>Our memories of how painful an experience was tends to depend on the peak intensity and how much pain was felt at the end</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>Participants in experiment were asked to immerse one hand in painfully cold ice water for 60 secs, then other hand in same ice water for 60 secs followed by a slightly less painful 30 secs more (Finn, 2011)
âž”When asked which trial they would prefer to repeat, most participants preferred the longer trial, with more net pain &ndash; but less pain at the end
<ul>
<li>Strategy of tapering off pain (though this means increasing net pain experienced) has been implemented in painful medical procedures like colonoscopies</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>Primacy-recency can color our memory of pleasures too
<ul>
<li>In one experiment, participants, on receiving a fifth and last piece of chocolate, were told it was their</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>next" one
<ul>
<li>Others were told it was their &ldquo;last&rdquo; piece</li><li>The latter liked the chocolate better and also rated the whole experiment as being more enjoyable (Oâ€™Brien & Elsworth, 2012)</li></ul><ul>
<li>Possible applications to romantic relationships?</li></ul></li><li>Explicit/declarative memory (with conscious recall): recall or recognition of information; can be verbally transmitted</li></ul><ul>
<li>Episodic memory: recall of personal facts</li><li>Semantic memory: recall of general facts</li></ul><ul>
<li>Implicit/non-declarative memory (without conscious recall): memory that influences oneâ€™s behavior or thought but does not itself enter consciousness; cannot be verbally transmitted</li></ul><ul>
<li>Procedural memory: Recall of how to do things</li></ul><h1 id=types-of-long-term-memory>
Types of Long-Term Memory
<a class=anchor href=#types-of-long-term-memory>#</a>
</h1><h2 id=implicit-association-test>
Implicit Association Test
<a class=anchor href=#implicit-association-test>#</a>
</h2><ul>
<li>Assign each name to the category to which it belongs by tapping your finger in the appropriate column. Do it as quickly as you can.</li></ul><p>âž”80% of those who have ever taken the test end up having pro- white associations, including about 50% of African Americans</p><ul>
<li>Does the IAT correlate with specific behaviors?
<ul>
<li>White college students who had more implicit negative stereotypes of Black people showed significantly more nonverbal signs of discomfort (e.g., standing further away, making less eye contact, stumbling over words more, smiling less) when interviewed by Black interviewers</li><li>People with a stronger pro-White bias on the IAT were also more likely to perceive anger and apparent threat in Black faces (Greenwald, Banaji, & Nosek, 2015; Hugenberg & Bodenhausen, 2003)</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=how-can-implicit-stereotyping-be-reduced>
How can implicit stereotyping be reduced?
<a class=anchor href=#how-can-implicit-stereotyping-be-reduced>#</a>
</h2><ul>
<li>In case of black-white implicit stereotyping, thinking about admired out-group member (Tiger Woods) and disliked in-group member (Jeffrey Dahmer) can reduce implicit IAT bias for up to 24 hours
<ul>
<li>Imagining counter-stereotypic women (e.g., strong women) similarly reduces implicit stereotyping</li><li>Students enrolled in a prejudice and conflict seminar taught by a black professor show a reduction in implicit biases after participation in course, as compared with controls (Devine, P.G., 2001) (Rudman, Ashmore, & Gary, 2001)</li></ul></li><li>The power of implicit attitudes: Newlywedsâ€™ implicit and explicit attitudes toward their new spouses were measured
<ul>
<li>Explicit measure: spouses asked to report extent to which they would describe their marriage using 15 pairs of opposing adjectives (e.g.,</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>good" vs. &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; &ldquo;satisfied vs. &ldquo;dissatisfied&rdquo;
<ul>

<li>Declarative memory is organized in &ldquo;chunks&rdquo;

<li>Procedural memory is encoded as production rules: actions for the system to perform, e.g., retrieve a chunk from memory, send a command to the motor module to perform an action
<ul>
<li>Production rules can be nested within each other, so that output of a given production rule will trigger firing of another production rule</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>All of the above modules are encoded in the form of physical symbols</li></ul></li><li>What makes ACT-R a hybrid architecture is that the symbolic, modular architecture is run on a subsymbolic base
<ul>
<li>ACT-R is designed to operate serially, so that at any given moment, only one production rule can be active, but how does it select that one?
<ul>
<li>The pattern-matching module controls which production rule gains access to the buffer by working out which production rule has the highest utility at the moment of selection, as determined by oHow likely the system is to achieve its current goal if the production rule is activated oThe cost of activating the production rule</li><li>The basic units of declarative memory are chunks, but each chunk is associated with a particular activation level, which is determined by oHow useful the chunk has been in the past oHow relevant the chunk is to the current situation and context</li><li>These calculations are subsymbolic and use an artificial neural networks approach</li></ul></li><li>Subsymbolic equations are also used to model how accessible information is in declarative memory</li></ul></li><li>The general information processing that takes place in the buffers is symbolic</li><li>In contrast, the calculations that determine whether or not a particular item of knowledge ends up in a buffer are subsymbolic</li></ul><h2 id=classification-of-memory-disorders>
