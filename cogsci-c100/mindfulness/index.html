Why Study Mindfulness?
<a class=anchor href=#why-study-mindfulness>#</a>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>Western research has indicated that meditation can be effectively used to:
<ul>
<li>Treat psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, sleep disorders, ADHD, and conduct disorder
<ul>
<li>Recent reviews indicate that overall effect sizes are modest, but mindfulness is still considered an evidence-based treatment for most psychological disorders</li>
<li>The small effects are comparable with what would be expected from the use of psychotropic medications (e.g., antidepressant) in a primary care population but without the associated toxicities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Treat physical conditions, including chronic pain and cardiovascular disease, and enhance immune system function</li>
<li>Lengthen life span quite dramatically &ndash; 30% reduction in mortality due to heart disease and 49% reduction in mortality due to cancer, according to one 20-year study</li>
<li>Slow the cognitive decline associated with “normal aging”</li>
<li>Increase activity in areas of the brain associated with optimism, empathy, attention, and emotional regulation &ndash; highly trained “super-meditators” show activity in these regions that is off the charts (Schneider, Alexander, Staggers, et al., 2005) (Lazar, Kerr, & Wasserman, 2005; Luders, Toga, Lepore et al., 2009)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All mindfulness therapies share a common aim of cultivating an attitude of awareness of the present moment with acceptance
<ul>
<li>This is an attitude that extends toward whatever is arising at the moment, including thoughts, feelings, and experiences of contact with the outer world</li>
<li>The aim is in line with the psychoanalytic view that it is primarily experiential avoidance that causes distress</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=awareness-and-acceptance>
Awareness and Acceptance
<a class=anchor href=#awareness-and-acceptance>#</a>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>Neuropsychological evidence that awareness/labeling of negative emotions actually reduces their intensity:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>fMRI study by Lieberman, Eisenberger, Crockett et al. (2007)
<ul>
<li>Participants were shown frightening faces/faces expressing strong emotions and asked to choose a word that described the emotion on display</li>
<li>Controls were asked merely to identify the gender of the people in the photos</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Labeling the fear-inducing object</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reduced activity in the amygdala, the seat of fear and other negative emotions</li>
<li>Increased activity in a parts of the prefrontal cortex (right ventrolateral and medial PFC) involved in vigilance and discrimination, relative to controls
<ul>
<li>Naming the emotion transformed the images from objects of fear to objects of scrutiny, potentially resulting in a more effective response</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src=/docs/cogsci-c100/mindfulness/emo.png alt></p>
<ul>
<li>Study on spider phobia (Kircanski, Lieberman, & Craske, 2012)
<ul>
<li>Four experimental conditions that differed in their instructions for what to do with the anxiety</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Label the anxiety felt about the spider</li>
<li>Reappraisal: think differently of the spider so that it feels less threatening</li>
<li>Distract from the anxiety elicited by the spider</li>
<li>No specific instruction (control)
<ul>
<li>Later (on Day 2 and Day 9), participants returned to the lab and were again exposed to spiders to test the long-term effects of their emotion manipulation</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Those who had been assigned to labeling their emotions had lower physiological reactivity to the spiders, as measured by skin conductance responses</li>
<li>Within the affect labeling condition, participants who verbalized a larger number of fear and anxiety words had even fewer skin conductance responses</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Researchers recruited participants who had a spider phobia and exposed them to spiders</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately though, being accepting and nonjudgmental is easier said than done because of our natural human tendency to avoid painful experiences
<ul>
<li>It is very difficult, if not impossible, to force ourselves to fully experience situations and emotions that we deem to be painful</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Traumatic experiences are a classic example of this</li>
<li>However, even in ordinary life, we are constantly dissociating from painful situations and emotions &ndash; or ones that we think may potentially cause pain
<ul>
<li>This may range from actual pain-inducing experiences to insights that might cause us to feel bad about ourselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is a limit to the extent to which we can force ourselves just to “be with” our anger or sadness or fear</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step One in mindfulness practice is to engage in focused meditation because</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>It is very difficult to be aware of ourselves and our surroundings if we are afflicted by “monkey mind”
<ul>
<li>Focused meditation allows us to calm monkey mind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focused meditation ultimately enables us to connect with the nonmoving mind and the “suchness” of experience, which produces a sense of general “Okness”
<ul>
<li>Meditation is a technique that can help resolve this problem of experiential avoidance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Focused meditation is just calmly abiding, with the object of concentration &ndash; not obsessive glomming
<ul>
<li>There should be a relaxed connection with the object</li>
<li>The aim is to “be present with the object,” not to lock onto it and grip it like a dog, or to concentrate on it the way you might concentrate on memorizing the details of an image</li>
<li>As the meditation develops, allow your perception of the object to change as you are present with the object on more and more subtle levels…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The focus becomes just stillness itself, rather than the physical object</li>
<li>You find that there is something in you that is imperturbable and open, fundamentally calm</li>
<li>Developing one-pointedness of concentration enables you to find one-pointedness in yourself, the non-moving mind, which resolves all things</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stilling the eyes is a way of stilling the mind</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=calm-abiding-practice>
Calm Abiding Practice
<a class=anchor href=#calm-abiding-practice>#</a>
</h2>
<ol>
<li>Find a quiet place and sit in a comfortable position with your spine straight. You can sit cross-legged or in a chair.</li>
<li>Tilt the chin very slightly down but do not allow the head to loll forward. Place your hands comfortably on your lap.</li>
<li>Take a few deep breaths.</li>
<li>Collect your attention, and begin to move it slowly down your body. Notice the sensations in each part of your body. Relax any tensions, particularly in the face, neck and hands.</li>
<li>Direct your gaze softly downwards or close your eyes if you wish.</li>
<li>Focus on an object (e.g., a bit of the wall in front of you, a statue, a sound like “Om”) or on the breath.</li>
<li>Be fully present with the object of your attention. If you are focusing on the breath, don’t gloss over the inhalation and say, “OK, well, this is the inhalation part” &ndash; that’s just labeling it. “Be with” each in-breath for its full duration and with each out-breath for its full duration, as if you were riding the waves of your own breathing. Seek nothing. No “next”!</li>
<li>Integrate your whole body in the experience. Meditation is state of full body awareness.</li>
<li>If your attention wanders (and it will!), simply release the thought and focus back on the object of your attention.</li>
<li>After a while, you can try noticing the distractions and acknowledging it with a simple word, e.g., thinking, wandering, hearing.
<ul>
<li>Yes, and in fact, depending on the physical condition, that might be highly advisable</li>
<li>There are four standard meditation positions: sitting, lying down flat on one’s back, standing, and walking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can focused meditation produce negative effects?
<ul>
<li>In general, focused meditation is considered a safe practice, but there are large individual differences in how people respond to any practice, so use good judgment and stop and seek help when necessary</li>
<li>Also, in particular, for those with trauma or abuse histories (or “fear types”), even basic meditation practices can can lead to intense, and possibly uncomfortable emotions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In those cases, when doing focused meditation, it is recommended that one direct attention to an external object or the feet, rather than the breath, as the latter may trigger too many memories and emotions</li>

<li>Try to perceive them as “events” in your mind.</li>
<li>Note their content and their charge while, if possible, not being drawn into thinking about them, or thinking the next thought, but just maintaining the “frame” through which you are observing the process of thought.</li>
<li>Note that an individual thought does not last long. It is impermanent. If it comes, it will go. Be aware of this.</li>
<li>Note how some thoughts keep coming back.</li>
<li>Note what feelings are associated with different thought contents.</li>
<li>If you get lost in all this, just go back to focusing on the object.

<li>If you are in an overall relatively positive frame of mind and the emotion is not very strong:

<li>Initially, you should only try to do this very briefly
<ul>
<li>This practice is not about analyzing thoughts or emotions</li>
<li>If you are still thinking about the emotion or the situation that caused the emotion 30 seconds later, STOP (this is important &ndash; you can harm yourself!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Try to experience the emotion fully in your bodyenergy-mind, that is, focus on the energy and physical sensations of the emotion, but do not let yourself get caught up in the content, in the story associated with the emotion</li>

<ul>
<li>Once you have substantial meditation experience, when you experience a negative emotion, you can
<ul>
<li>Look straight at the emotion and let it dissolve or “liberate” as it arises</li>
<li>You can instantaneously see the various factors that caused the emotion to arise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mindfulness gives us insight into the narrative we have about ourselves
<ul>
<li>Your ordinary mind cannot do this: remember that meditation is not done with the ordinary thinking mind</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When we think, we just stay caught in our own conceptual systems, our own habitual ways of looking at things</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Meditation accesses a deeper mind with much greater awareness that is able to solve problems more effectively</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rather than holding beliefs (e.g., “I am worthless”) to be a true description of who we are, we see the narrative as a constellation of thoughts</li>
<li>This can foster more breathing room and lead to increased well being</li>
<li>It’s not so much about changing the narrative, but rather about changing our relationship to it</li>

Mindfulness: Working with Difficult Emotions
<a class=anchor href=#mindfulness-working-with-difficult-emotions>#</a>
</h4>
<ol>
<li>Start with calm-abiding meditation.</li>
<li>Now if there&rsquo;s something difficult that&rsquo;s happening for you &ndash; a difficult emotion, or a physical sensation that&rsquo;s hard, let your attention go to that. It may be an aching in your shoulder or back, or a headache, or it could be a sense of sadness, or anxiety, or anger.
<ul>
<li>Where do you feel that sensation in your body?</li>
<li>Where do you feel that emotion in your body?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Notice it, just notice it for one moment. Tap into it, feel it. Make sure to breathe.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=3>
<li>And now return your attention back down to the object of concentration and the centered stillness. And just let yourself stay there for a moment. Feeling it, sensing it, relaxing, maintaining the mindfulness, yet giving yourself a break from what could be potentially overwhelming to feel.</li>
<li>And now once again return your attention to that part of the body that feels unpleasant &ndash; the body ache or pain, or the emotion, the sensations of the emotion in your body, the vibrations in your chest, or the clenching in your belly, or the tightness in your jaw. Just notice, and breathe, and let it be there. Let whatever is there, be there.</li>
<li>And then bring your attention again back down to the feeling of centeredness. Relaxing, staying present and alert, feeling the safety, the connection in that place.</li>
<li>Now let yourself stay connected to this place, but see if you can cast what we might call a sidelong glance at the difficult area in your body. Is it possible to still feel connected to you body in the area that feels good, and yet know there&rsquo;s something going on that feels unpleasant, and just let it be there? Keeping maybe 75% of your attention on the part that feels peaceful and at ease, still breathing, casting the sidelong glance at this difficult area, noticing what happens to it. Is it growing or shrinking? Is it changing, shifting into something else? Become aware of whatever it is it&rsquo;s doing, relaxing, breathing. (Adapted from MARC UCLA guided meditations)</li>

<li>Devise an alternative behavior
<ul>
<li>Note how you feel when you utilize the replacement activity instead</li>

<li>If you are unable to implement the replacement activity, simply note how you feel as you continue to engage in the old habit and in particular, how you feel when you finally stop

<p>The promise of happiness from cravings often misleads, so one strategy for overcoming addictions is to mindfully focus attention on the actual experience when indulging a craving or temptation, so as to compare it with the expectation of reward that preceded it. – Kelly McGonigal</p>

<li>Ex: Binging on hot cheetos and YouTube videos
<ul>
<li>Become more aware of how you feel physically and emotionally as you sit there munching, watching video after video
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you are feeling tired or hopeless</li>
<li>Once you recognize that, you can see if you can devise some other activity that will more effectively alleviate the tiredness or sense of hopelessness, e.g, going to bed or talking to a friend</li>

<li>Also, become more aware of exactly how you feel when you finally do turn off the computer and consciously note those feelings
<ul>
<li>This will increase your chances of being able to prevent a repetition of the behavior in the long run</li>

<li>Feeling and accepting our negative emotions allows us to transform those emotions</li>
</ul>

<li>But if I accept myself fully, won’t that undermine my motivation to try hard and improve?</li>
<li>Actually, it’s just the opposite: beating up on yourself results in a less effectual response
- If an experience is painful, we tend to avoid looking at it, so we don’t learn from it
- The attempt to suppress the negative thoughts and emotions saps our energetic resources
- Feeling bad about ourselves causes us to engage in more unhealthy habits</li>

<li>Self-compassion group: saw an additional statement embedded in the instructions that read, “If you had difficulty with the test you just took, you’re not alone.

Open, Nonjudgmental Awareness
<a class=anchor href=#open-nonjudgmental-awareness>#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mindfulness practice is about developing greater awareness</li>
<li>Taken to higher levels, this can produce states of great bliss
<ul>
<li>If we fully connect with the “suchness” of things in our body-energy-mind, we find a ground which holds everything and gives rise to a sensation of great bliss in the center of the body</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This takes the truism that true happiness must come from within to a whole new level!
- The experience of bliss in turn makes it possible to connect even more fully with the suchness of things, to be even more inclusive…</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The above is accompanied by a transformation of perception</p>
<ul>
<li>The big secret is that enlightenment is right here right now
<ul>
<li>You see that everything is perfect just as it is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You don’t need to change anything bad into anything good or to “fix” yourself in any way</li>
<li>Ironically, this actually makes it easier to effect changes because your energy is no longer all tied up in beating yourself up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obstacles to open, nonjudgmental awareness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mental elaborations stand in stark contrast to the kind of open, nonjudgmental, direct awareness described above
<ul>
<li>As Rick Hanson points out, most of the negative emotions we feel do not come from actual aversive events, but from our reactions to them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Suppose you’re walking through a dark room at night and stub your toe on a chair
<ul>
<li>Right after the first stab of pain comes “Who moved that darn chair?!”</li>
<li>This then continues to elaborate, maybe moving to the person whom you think moved the chair and all the evil things they have done to you</li>
<li>In addition, attachment to/obsession with particular outcomes prevent us from experiencing the kind of open, nonjudgmental awareness associated with deep meditative states</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mindfulness practice is not just about sitting on a meditation cushion; it’s about a way of being that extends to how we engage in all of our daily activities
<ul>
<li>It’s knowing that you are exactly where you should be this moment and appreciating this moment, engaging in activities with full focus of attention</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ex: Walking meditation is about really enjoying the walking &ndash; walking not in order to arrive, but just to enjoy each step</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We shake off all worries and anxieties, not thinking of the future, not thinking of the past, but just enjoying the present moment</li>
<li>We are aware of the contact between our feet and the Earth, “walking as if we are kissing the Earth with our feet”

<ol>
<li>Visualize a love that someone gave you that really moved you, perhaps in your childhood. Remember a particular instance when they really showed you love, and you felt their love vividly.</li>
<li>Now let that feeling arise again in your heart and infuse you with gratitude.
<ul>
<li>As you do so, your love will go out naturally to that person who evoked it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You will remember then that even though you may not always feel that you have been loved enough, you were loved genuinely once. Knowing that now will make you feel again that you are, as that person made you feel then, worthy of love and really lovable.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=3>
<li>Let your heart open now, and let love flow from it; then extend this love to all beings. Begin with those who are closest to you, then extend your love to friends and to acquaintances, then to neighbors, to strangers, then even to those whom you don’t like or have difficulties with, even those whom you might consider as your “enemies,” and finally to the whole universe.
<ul>
<li>Let this love become more and more boundless. (From The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying)</li>

<li>Research on Compassion Practice (Lutz, Greischar, & Rawlings, 2004)
<ul>
<li>Compassion meditation does not focus on particular objects, memories, or images; rather the emphasis is on generating feelings of benevolence and compassion, causing them to “pervade the mind as a way of being”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Results:
<ul>
<li>Long-term practitioners produced showed high levels of activity in gamma-band frequencies (25-42+ Hz) and increased neural synchrony</li>
<li>This involves large regions of the brain pulsing in synchrony 30-80 times a second</li>
<li>As they went deeper into meditation (jhana states), there appeared to be both a spreading and a strengthening of gamma wave activity</li>
<li>When controls engaged in compassion meditation, they also showed an increase in gamma activity, but the increase was slight</li>

<ul>
<li>Gamma waves
<ul>
<li>Type of very high-frequency brain wave</li>
<li>Size of the gamma wave is related to the number of neurons firing in sync</li>
<li>Research has linked neural synchrony of high-frequency brain waves to enhanced attention, working memory, learning and conscious perception</li>
<li>Greater synchrony between various sections of the brain indicates greater integration of cognitive and affective functions and less dissociation</li>
<li>Compartmentalization of brain functions is associated with aging and cognitive decline</li>

<p>EEG studies by Richard Davidson found that meditation practice is associated with increased left prefrontal activity (Davidson, 2012)</p>

<li>Meditation, Prefrontal Dominance & Optimism
<ul>
<li>Early on, Davidson had noticed that an elderly Tibetan monk in one of his studies showed much greater predominance of activity in the left prefrontal than any of the other people previously tested</li>
<li>Research on other long-term meditators provided further confirmatory evidence</li>
<li>For instance, one meditation adept, Matthieu</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ricard, showed increased left pre-frontal cortical activity that was 4.5 standard deviations outside the standard bell curve
<img src=/docs/cogsci-c100/mindfulness/monks.png alt></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>An early study found that less extensive meditation practice (40 minutes a day for 8-10 weeks) was also associated with a significant shift in hemispheric dominance</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In addition, degree of shift in activity from right to left prefrontal was found to correlate with enhancement in immune system (resistance to flu virus) (Davidson, Kabat-Zinn, Schiumacher et al., 2003)</li>

</li>
<li>Effects of meditation on these psychological, as well as physical, conditions are probably mediated at least in part by reduction in cortisol levels</li>

<p>Even novice meditators showed increase in gamma waves during compassion meditation but effects endured past period of meditation only in long-term practitioners (Lutz, Greischar, & Rawlings, 2004)</p>

<li>Some recent studies try to address this problem by asking participants to engage in specific types of meditation practice while in the scanner</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The problem of multiple practices is compounded by the fact that many of the long-term meditators practice within traditions that require extensive preliminary training involving
<ul>
<li>Working with the mind, e.g., developing greater awareness of the feeling tone of thoughts</li>
