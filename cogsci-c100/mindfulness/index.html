Why Study Mindfulness?
<a class=anchor href=#why-study-mindfulness>#</a>
</h2><ul>
<li>Western research has indicated that meditation can be effectively used to:
<ul>
<li>Treat psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, sleep disorders, ADHD, and conduct disorder
<ul>
<li>Recent reviews indicate that overall effect sizes are modest, but mindfulness is still considered an evidence-based treatment for most psychological disorders</li><li>The small effects are comparable with what would be expected from the use of psychotropic medications (e.g., antidepressant) in a primary care population but without the associated toxicities</li></ul></li><li>Treat physical conditions, including chronic pain and cardiovascular disease, and enhance immune system function</li><li>Lengthen life span quite dramatically &ndash; 30% reduction in mortality due to heart disease and 49% reduction in mortality due to cancer, according to one 20-year study (Schneider, Alexander, Staggers, et al., 2005)
<ul>
<li>If this is replicable then you&rsquo;d make lots of money &ndash; part of the reason for the research interest</li></ul></li><li>Slow the cognitive decline associated with “normal aging” (Lazar, Kerr, & Wasserman, 2005; Luders, Toga, Lepore et al., 2009)</li><li>Increase activity in areas of the brain associated with optimism, empathy, attention, and emotional regulation
<ul>
<li>Highly trained “super-meditators” show activity in these regions that is off the charts</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=calm-abiding-practice>
Calm-abiding practice
<a class=anchor href=#calm-abiding-practice>#</a>
</h2><ul>
<li>All mindfulness therapies share a common aim of <strong>cultivating an attitude of awareness of the present moment with acceptance</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is an attitude that extends toward whatever is arising at the moment, including thoughts, feelings, and experiences of contact with the outer world</li><li>The aim is in line with the psychoanalytic view that it is primarily experiential avoidance that causes distress</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=research>
Research
<a class=anchor href=#research>#</a>
</h3><ul>
<li>Neuropsychological evidence that awareness/labeling of negative emotions actually reduces their intensity &ndash; fMRI study by Lieberman, Eisenberger, Crockett et al. (2007)
<div class="book-columns flex flex-wrap">
<div class="flex-even markdown-inner">
<ul>
<li>Participants were shown frightening faces/faces expressing strong emotions and asked to choose a word that described the emotion on display</li></ul></div><div class="flex-even markdown-inner">
<p>
<img src=/docs/cogsci-c100/mindfulness/emo.png alt>
</div></div><ul>
<li>Controls were asked merely to identify the gender of the people in the photos
- Labeling the fear-inducing object
<ul>
<li>Reduced activity in the amygdala, the seat of fear and other negative emotions</li><li>Increased activity in a parts of the prefrontal cortex (right ventrolateral and medial PFC) involved in vigilance and discrimination, relative to controls</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>Naming the emotion transformed the images from objects of fear to objects of scrutiny, potentially resulting in a more effective response</li></ul></li></ul><hr>
<ul>
<li>Study on spider phobia (Kircanski, Lieberman, & Craske, 2012)
<ul>
<li>Four experimental conditions that differed in their instructions for what to do with the anxiety
<ol>
<li>Label the anxiety felt about the spider</li><li>Reappraisal: think differently of the spider so that it feels less threatening</li><li>Distract from the anxiety elicited by the spider</li><li>No specific instruction (control)</li></ol></li><li>Later (on Day 2 and Day 9), participants returned to the lab and were again exposed to spiders to test the long-term effects of their emotion manipulation</li></ul><ul>
<li>Those who had been assigned to labeling their emotions had lower physiological reactivity to the spiders, as measured by skin conductance responses</li><li>Within the affect labeling condition, participants who verbalized a larger number of fear and anxiety words had even fewer skin conductance responses</li></ul><ul>
<li>Researchers recruited participants who had a spider phobia and exposed them to spiders</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=limitations>
Limitations
<a class=anchor href=#limitations>#</a>
</h3><ul>
<li>Unfortunately though, being accepting and nonjudgmental is easier said than done because of our natural human tendency to avoid painful experiences
<ul>
<li>It is very difficult, if not impossible, to force ourselves to fully experience situations and emotions that we deem to be painful</li></ul><ul>
<li>Traumatic experiences are a classic example of this</li><li>However, even in ordinary life, we are constantly dissociating from painful situations and emotions &ndash; or ones that we think may potentially cause pain
<ul>
<li>This may range from actual pain-inducing experiences to insights that might cause us to feel bad about ourselves</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>There is a limit to the extent to which we can force ourselves just to “be with” our anger or sadness or fear</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=meditation>
Meditation
<a class=anchor href=#meditation>#</a>
</h3><ul>
<li>Meditation is a technique that can help resolve this problem of experiential avoidance
<ul>
<li>Step One in mindfulness practice is to engage in <strong>focused meditation</strong> because&mldr;
<ol>
<li>It is very difficult to be aware of ourselves and our surroundings if we are afflicted by &ldquo;
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_mind>monkey mind</a>&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Focused meditation allows us to calm monkey mind</li></ul></li><li>Focused meditation ultimately enables us to connect with the nonmoving mind and the “suchness” of experience, which produces a sense of general “Okness”</li></ol></li></ul></li><li>Focused meditation is just <strong>calmly abiding</strong>, with the object of concentration &ndash; not obsessive glomming
<ul>
<li>There should be a relaxed connection with the object</li><li>The aim is to “be present with the object,” not to lock onto it and grip it like a dog, or to concentrate on it the way you might concentrate on memorizing the details of an image</li><li>As the meditation develops, allow your perception of the object to change as you are present with the object on more and more subtle levels…
<ul>
<li>The focus becomes just stillness itself, rather than the physical object</li><li>You find that there is something in you that is imperturbable and open, fundamentally calm</li><li>Developing one-pointedness of concentration enables you to find one-pointedness in yourself, the non-moving mind, which resolves all things</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote>
<p>Stilling the eyes is a way of stilling the mind</p></blockquote></li></ul><h3 id=instructions>
Instructions
<a class=anchor href=#instructions>#</a>
</h3><ol>
<li>Find a quiet place and sit in a comfortable position with your spine straight. You can sit cross-legged or in a chair.</li><li>Tilt the chin very slightly down but do not allow the head to loll forward. Place your hands comfortably on your lap.</li><li>Take a few deep breaths.</li><li>Collect your attention, and begin to move it slowly down your body. Notice the sensations in each part of your body. Relax any tensions, particularly in the face, neck and hands.</li><li>Direct your gaze softly downwards or close your eyes if you wish.</li><li>Focus on an object (e.g., a bit of the wall in front of you, a statue, a sound like “Om”) or on the breath.</li><li>Be fully present with the object of your attention. If you are focusing on the breath, don’t gloss over the inhalation and say, “OK, well, this is the inhalation part” &ndash; that’s just labeling it. “Be with” each in-breath for its full duration and with each out-breath for its full duration, as if you were riding the waves of your own breathing. Seek nothing. No “next”!</li><li>Integrate your whole body in the experience. Meditation is state of full body awareness.</li><li>If your attention wanders (and it will!), simply release the thought and focus back on the object of your attention.</li><li>After a while, you can try noticing the distractions and acknowledging it with a simple word, e.g., thinking, wandering, hearing.</li></ol><h3 id=meditation-q--a>
Meditation Q & A
<a class=anchor href=#meditation-q--a>#</a>
</h3><ol>
<li>If one has a physical condition that makes sitting uncomfortable, is it OK to meditate while lying down or standing up?
<ul>
<li>Yes, and in fact, depending on the physical condition, that might be highly advisable</li><li>There are four standard meditation positions: sitting, lying down flat on one’s back, standing, and walking</li></ul></li><li>Can focused meditation produce negative effects?
<ul>
<li>In general, focused meditation is considered a safe practice, but there are large individual differences in how people respond to any practice, so use good judgment and stop and seek help when necessary
<ul>
<li>In particular, for those with trauma or abuse histories (or “fear types”), even basic meditation practices can can lead to intense, and possibly uncomfortable emotions</li></ul></li><li>In those cases, when doing focused meditation, it is recommended that one direct attention to an <strong>external object</strong> or the feet, rather than the breath, as the latter may trigger too many memories and emotions</li></ul></li></ol><hr>
<ul>
<li>Lurid example of the agitated mind and how it causes us to be unable to sit alone with our thoughts and emotions
<ul>
<li>Participants were asked to sit in a chair, without a device or a book and without falling asleep, for 6 to 15 minutes</li><li>They were given the option to self-administer mild electric shocks rather than just sit alone with their thoughts</li></ul><ul>
<li>67% of men and 25% of women did just that! (Wilson, Reinhard, Westgate, et al., 2014)</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=relationship-between-attention-and-happiness>
Relationship between attention and happiness
<a class=anchor href=#relationship-between-attention-and-happiness>#</a>
</h3><ul>
<li>Study in which 1000 people were texted at random times throughout the day</li><li>As soon as participants received text, they had to answer 3 questions
<ol>
<li>What are you doing right now?</li><li>Where is your mind right now? Is it focused on what you’re doing or is it focused elsewhere?</li><li>How happy or unhappy are you right at this very moment? (Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010)</li></ol></li><li>Results:
<ul>

<li>If you are in an overall relatively positive frame of mind and the emotion is not very strong:
<ul>
<li>Try to experience the emotion fully in your body-energy-mind, that is, focus on the energy and physical sensations of the emotion, but do not let yourself get caught up in the content, in the story associated with the emotion
<blockquote>
<p>You may not feel happy due to some event/circumstance that clouds your vision. Recognize these emotions&ndash; what is this stimuli evoking that you wish to avoid? Try to focus on this emotion and realize that it is just that &ndash; an emotion, sensations in your body. They are not the end-of-the-world, just sensations, and as such they are malleable and can be changed if you believe so.</p></blockquote></li><li>Initially, you should only try to do this very briefly
<ul>
<li>This practice is not about analyzing thoughts or emotions</li><li>If you are still thinking about the emotion or the situation that caused the emotion 30 seconds later, STOP (this is important &ndash; you can harm yourself!)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><hr>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Look straight at the emotion and let it dissolve or “liberate” as it arises

</h4><ol>
<li>Start with calm-abiding meditation.</li><li>Now if there&rsquo;s something difficult that&rsquo;s happening for you &ndash; a difficult emotion, or a physical sensation that&rsquo;s hard, let your attention go to that. It may be an aching in your shoulder or back, or a headache, or it could be a sense of sadness, or anxiety, or anger.

Feeling it, sensing it, relaxing, maintaining the mindfulness, yet giving yourself a break from what could be potentially overwhelming to feel.</li><li>And now once again return your attention to that part of the body that feels unpleasant &ndash; the body ache or pain, or the emotion, the sensations of the emotion in your body, the vibrations in your chest, or the clenching in your belly, or the tightness in your jaw. Just notice, and breathe, and let it be there. Let whatever is there, be there.</li><li>And then bring your attention again back down to the feeling of centeredness. Relaxing, staying present and alert, feeling the safety, the connection in that place.</li><li>Now let yourself stay connected to this place, but see if you can cast what we might call a sidelong glance at the difficult area in your body. Is it possible to still feel connected to you body in the area that feels good, and yet know there&rsquo;s something going on that feels unpleasant, and just let it be there? Keeping maybe 75% of your attention on the part that feels peaceful and at ease, still breathing, casting the sidelong glance at this difficult area, noticing what happens to it. Is it growing or shrinking? Is it changing, shifting into something else? Become aware of whatever it is it&rsquo;s doing, relaxing, breathing.</li></ol><h4 id=using-mindfulness-to-break-habits>

<li>The end sucks, and your body will dwell on this emotion. Thus, that will reduce the odds or your engaging in the behavior again in the future</li></ul><blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Ex: Binging on hot cheetos and YouTube videos
<ul>
<li>Become more aware of how you feel physically and emotionally as you sit there munching, watching video after video
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you are feeling tired or hopeless</li><li>Once you recognize that, you can see if you can devise some other activity that will more effectively alleviate the tiredness or sense of hopelessness, e.g, going to bed or talking to a friend</li></ul></li><li>Again, note that this is simply data collection
<ul>
<li>It’s not about beating yourself up for being “bad” or “lacking in discipline.”</li><li>Just be fully aware of what you are experiencing</li></ul></li><li>Also, become more aware of exactly how you feel when you finally do turn off the computer and consciously note those feelings
<ul>
<li>This will increase your chances of being able to prevent a repetition of the behavior in the long run</li></ul></li><li>Mindfulness might also allow you to notice things that help stop the behavior, e.g., only taking small portions so that you would need to get up to obtain more hot cheetos</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=guided-meditations>

<li>Ex: Walking meditation is about really enjoying the walking &ndash; walking not in order to arrive, but just to enjoy each step</li></ul><ul>
<li>We shake off all worries and anxieties, not thinking of the future, not thinking of the past, but just enjoying the present moment</li><li>We are aware of the contact between our feet and the Earth

</h2><ul>
<li>The modest <strong>psychological effects</strong> found in studies of short-term mindfulness contrasts with the much larger effects of <em>neuroimaging and reaction time studies</em> on long-term meditation practitioners

<li>This suggests that
<ul>
<li>Results of meditation studies depend in part on amount of practice and amount of training/teaching received by practitioner</li><li>Changes in brain function and structure may precede noticeable psychological and behavioral changes
<ul>
<li>Even novice meditators showed increase in gamma waves during compassion meditation but effects endured past period of meditation only in long-term practitioners (Lutz, Greischar, & Rawlings, 2004)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>One problem though that pertains even to the well-controlled studies with long-term meditators (e.g., showing increased left prefrontal activity in meditators and enhanced ability to detect microexpressions) is that it’s not clear precisely which meditation practice(s) may be contributing to those effects
<ul>
<li>Some recent studies try to address this problem by asking participants to engage in specific types of meditation practice while in the scanner</li></ul></li><li>The problem of multiple practices is compounded by the fact that many of the long-term meditators practice within traditions that require extensive preliminary training involving
<ul>
<li>Working with the mind, e.g., developing greater awareness of the <strong>feeling tone of thoughts</strong></li><li><strong>Ethical precepts:</strong> just focusing on doing what you know at a deep level to be right is another doorway to great meditation experience

<li>Sort of like little kid screaming about getting shots, when the punches they get roughhousing on the playground are actually many times more painful</li></ul><ul>
