<a class=anchor href=#mysticism-or-psychosis-extra>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>&ldquo;From the first, the experience seemed to me to be holy. What I saw was the Power of Love – the name came to me at once – the Power that I knew somehow to have made all the universes, past, present and to come; to be utterly infinite, an infinity of infinities, to have conquered the Power of Hate, its opposite, and thus created the sun, the moon, the planets, the earth, light, life, joy and peace, never ending&mldr;.In that peace I felt utterly and completely forgiven, relieved from all burden of sin. The whole infinity seemed to open up before me, and during the weeks and months that followed I passed through experiences which are virtually indescribable. The complete transformation of “reality” transported me as it were into the Kingdom of Heaven. I feel so close to God, so inspired by His Spirit, that in a sense I am God. I see the future, plan the Universe, save mankind; I am utterly and completely immortal; I am even male and female. The whole Universe, animate and inanimate, past, present and future is within me; all things are possible.”</p><blockquote><p>Answer: Psychotic episode of John Custance</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>All at once, without warning of any kind, I found myself wrapped in a flame-colored cloud. For an instant I thought of fire, an immense conflagration somewhere close by in that great city; the next, I knew that the fire was within myself. Directly afterward there came upon me a sense of exultation, of immense joyousness accompanied or immediately followed by an intellectual illumination impossible to describe. Among other things, I did not merely come to believe, but I saw that the universe is not composed of dead matter, but is, on the contrary, a living Presence; I became conscious in myself of eternal life, but a consciousness that I possessed eternal life then; I saw that all men are immortal; that the cosmic order is such that without any peradventure all things work together for the good of each and all; that the foundation principle of the world, of all the worlds, is what we call love, and the happiness of each and all is in the long run absolutely certain.”</p><blockquote><p>Answer: Mystical experience of R.M. Bucke, Canadian psychiatrist</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>“When I walk the fields, I am oppressed, now and then, by an innate feeling that everything I see has a meaning, if only I could understand it. And this feeling of being surrounded with truth, which I cannot grasp, amounts to indescribable awe sometimes. Have you not felt that your real soul was imperceptible to your mental vision, excepting a few hollow moments?”</p><blockquote><p>Answer: Mystical experience of Charles Kingsley, a Christian mystic</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I am simple; I need not think. Feeling is all; feeling is love. God is love. Love is the expression of God. Feeling is only fire. Fired by God. The dancer becomes the divining motion. Dance is the divine in the world. The Dionysian religion. Love is God. I am love; I am God.”</p><blockquote><p>Answer: Psychotic experience of Nijinsky, Russian ballet dancer</p></blockquote></blockquote><ul><li>Distinctions:<ul><li>The mystic, unlike the person with psychosis, develops a strong sense of self</li><li>The mystic tends to reduce self-importance; psychosis tends to involve inflated self-importance</li><li>The mystic tends to have ever increasing serenity, which leads him or her to be more involved in life and more loving towards all beings; those with psychosis have difficulty relating with anybody and clearly withdraw from the world</li><li>The mystical experience, though ineffable, is usually coherent and what is described is clear; those with psychosis tend to be thought-disordered so their descriptions are not very lucid</li><li>The mystical experience is usually brief, though it leaves so vivid an imprint that it can be remembered clearly 25 years later; in psychosis, the person may get stuck in the experience and be unable to come out of it</li><li>In mysticism, there is a gradual reduction of attachment to the world; in psychosis, there is a fusion and a continuous shifting of the world</li><li>The mystic tends to take responsibility, not only for themselves, but for all aspects of life around them; those with psychosis project out of themselves those things that seem especially negative</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><h2 id=near-death-experience>Near-Death Experience

They concluded that future neuroscientific studies are likely to reveal the neuroanatomical basis of the NDE which will lead to the demystification of the subject without needing paranormal explanations</p></blockquote></li><li>Typical report:<blockquote><p>“I was left with an awareness that something more was going on in life than just the physical part of it&mldr; There is more than just consuming life, more than just what we can buy.
